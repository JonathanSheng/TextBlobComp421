0,"The McAfee Internet Security Suite has some great features beyond just virus scanning.  It has anti-phishing and anti-spyware protection.  It also has firewall and system backup/restore software included.  One thing I've found useful is when someone sends you a link via instant messaging programs, you can scan the link as well.  I'm always skeptical to click on links and this is a good feature.  You can also prevent security scans screens from taking over your computer when you are working in full screen.  They will run in the background.  It does slow down your computer a little bit, but has not been unbearable.

You can install on up to three computers in your home - for a very good price.  We only installed on one PC as we don't use the other one and the third is a Mac.  If you need help from the McAfee folks, you will need to ""chat"" with them online (free), unless you want to pay for telephone support.  This would be a downside for many... I would rate it 3 stars as-is and 4 stars if it would have included free telephone support."

0.5,"Family Tree Maker (FTM) for Mac 3 package includes main software (computer program) in the box and 3-mo membership to Ancestry valued now at $60 ($19.99/mo) making the software alone inexpensive. The program is well designed and easy to use for its very intuitive interface (screen layout). It provides full access to Ancestry's database over the Internet thus necessary to have provided. Unlike FTM for Mac 2, this Mac version 3 has as many features as its PC (MS Windows) equivalent package, which is by far the best of its kind on the market, and set the standard in the field.  Finally, the Mac users are not disadvantaged... much."

0.5,"It is hard for me to review this, since I thought I was getting the Standard version of Office, and expecting fun things like the Ebook Editor which I knew I would use a lot.  Instead I received the Home and Student Edition.  That instead is a bare bones version of Office.

WHAT YOU GET
Word Perfect (works like previous version except perhaps a little faster)
Quattro Pro (works like previous version)
Presentations
Word Perfect Lightning digital notebook

You also get fonts, dictionary, digital photos, templates, graphics, basic graphics editor, batch conversion from Word files, and training videos.

IS IT WORTH IT?
Yes, this program works well for the price, although honestly, if you can afford the upgrade price of the Standard version or others, I would go for that instead.  I really wanted the Ebook Editor, PDF creator, and some of the other cool features of the Standard version which is what I thought I had requested.

The program works well and seems to be a tiny bit faster than the previous X6 version.  I am using this with Windows 7 64-bit.

This is great for general home use and student use who need basics which are a cut above super basic.  It is a solid program so far, and despite my disappointment in the version I received, I still think it is decent for what you get.

I will edit this review as I continue to use the program if there are any other important points that I want to make if I find differences in the program from version X6.  As it stands now from the time I have used it and played with it, it is quite similar to the previous version of this edition of Office, which I did use with very few problems.  I got files to convert pretty easily from Word, and was able to save them in the proper file form as well, that others could read with Word.

I am giving this four stars, because I think that they should have added a simple Ebook editor and PDF capabilities to this edition like they have in the Standard.  Many academic software versions come with the same as professional programs with a few small things left out sometimes just for a more reasonable price.  I think they cut this one back a bit too far, but it still is decent for student use, but the price is a bit high, in my opinion for what you get (compared to the upgrade edition for standard."

0,"This is ok but I'm not sure how it's levels 1-3. I got it because my son is taking Spanish and we took Spanish many years ago. I thought it would be a great way to strengthen his skills and rebuild ours together. But, this is mainly good for conversational phrases to be used while traveling."

0.5,"I've used TurboTax for years, always reliable. This year they put features back in that you had to buy the ""Premier"" version to get last year (I bought the ""Deluxe and used the Feds Schedule E) that year.

I often stop in the middle of preparing taxes to do something else.  This year TurboTax kept wanting to start at the beginning again, which shouldn't happen.

Their ""Print"" set up requires WAY too much paper, so I print each completed form page separately (two-sided). I print the signature page, we sign and date it, and I scan it, then print the front page on the back of the original signature page. The Feds get their original signature, the state returns we file get their copy with an original front page printed on a copy of the scanned signature page, and we kept one for our files."

0,"This is the first time I ever got a maps and streets program. Usually, I just go onto google maps and search it up. The installation process of this was easy. Although, for some reason, the first installation got corrupted and I had to re-install, which is not a big deal to me.

I am usually an expert when it comes to computer softwares and this took just a little bit of a learning curve. While it is pretty easy to figure out how to plan a route, it would have been nicer if the route options had its own button in the top bar.

I enjoyed the options, seeing how much fuel would be needed to get to a certain place. What I found though when searching for nearby places is that it was very difficult to find some restaurants, even though I know it is there. And searching for Six Flags was kind of an art as it had to be typed in a certain way for it to find the one that we were looking for. Another feature that it lacks is the text message feature. While I have found a way to text an address to my phone, there was really no option for me to text the full route to my phone, which was irritating. I also tried to look online and in the manual with no real help.

Overall, it's a decent software with still a lot of features I have no use for (GPS for example). I still do go onto google maps since it is easiest way to get directions from point A to B."

0,"I have to hand it to Microsoft for Office 2008's ease of installation. Usually, when I purchase any sort of Microsoft product, I'm stuck dealing with all sorts of ridiculous issues and errors before I even get to try it out. With Office 2008, everything installed without a hitch and I was able to start using it in no time. As far as functionality and features go, this one is hit or miss. I've had no issues with PowerPoint or Word, which are the programs I use the most. Excel, on the other hand, is mysteriously missing features that are integral to the overall usefulness of the program. This is baffling, and there really is no excuse for it. Thankfully in my case, Excel isn't a necessity, but if it's something you'll need to make use of, you might want to reconsider before purchasing Office 2008."

0.5,"I downloaded Windows 8 and upgraded from Windows 7 on my non-touch screen desktop computer. The first thing I liked is the desktop has very few changes and I can continue to use it just like was in Windows 7. That was quite comforting. I had created a disk image and recovery disk in case I wanted to go back to Windows 7. Within 10 minutes I knew I wouldn't go back.

The Start Screen offers fun full screen or split screen applications. It extends Windows into the world that has become familiar to me when I'm using my iPod Touch. I think Microsoft is doing exactly the right thing by blending the touch screen world of apps with the traditional wide spread Windows application environment. When I buy a convertible tablet/laptop I'll have the best of both worlds, a touch screen tablet, and the ability to run all of my applications like MS Excel, Quicken, TurboTax and others.

I don't have trouble with the learning curve, I think within 20 minutes I was able to do everything I wanted including finding things like the Control Panel.

My complaints so far are a couple of little things but they bother me...

First when I bring the computer out of sleep mode it doesn't come up in the login screen where I can just type my password. It comes up in a new screen showing a digital clock and some information like a mail message all on a user selectable background. I have to click Return to get to the password screen. This may seem little but I just don't know why it is important to have this other screen. At least they could allow me to disable it but I haven't found that option if it exists.

Second the new File Explorer has some nice features but they removed a feature that I used all the time and there is no decent way to get the same function back. When viewing photo thumbnails in the Windows 7 Explorer I was able to see the thumbnails, a large image of the photo, and at the bottom of the screen some details from the file such as the camera aperture setting. That details bar on the bottom is gone. You now have an option to view the large photo OR details but not both. This is a big disappointment to me.

The rest of the changes, and there are a lot, will just take some time to get used to but as I said just staying with the desktop is quite similar to the Windows 7 environment so it is easy to use.

Now that I have Windows 8 Pro for only $39.99 upgrade price I will be ready to buy a convertible tablet and have the same OS on both platforms. I hope someone comes out with an iPod Touch like device running Windows 8 so I can have the same OS on all three platforms."

0.5,Love the face that my documents integrate fully and seamlessly with One Drive so my important docs are available anywhere I am.

1,"I got this installed on my computer, and it was almost overwhelming how much data and information that is presented.  An attempt is made to segregate it, but if you watch any of the company's videos, you'll see there's an overwhelming amount of data.  It's all good mind, you and it's easy to get lost looking at pictures, seeing videos, watching trails.

It's a superb product, but I can easily see where some people might get overwhelmed.  Still, if you dive into it, you're gonna experience the Bible in a completely new way.  Not that this product is changing the word of God, but just presenting it in a new fashion.  In this day and age of multimedia everything, and online that, and Twitter this...  It's kind of inevitable that a multimedia bible like this would exist.

One issue though.  Installation takes awhile if you want to put everything on your hard drive.  There are three DVD's in the package, and the default installation just goes from Disc 1.  That's not too bad.  But if you want to do the ""full"" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install.  I've installed multi disc programs before, and they haven't taken anywhere near that amount of time.  Once it was all installed, the C:\ProgramData\Glo directory on my Windows 7 machine had a total of 10.8Gb of data, and a whopping 351,892 files!  Wow."

-1,"What a pathetic O.S.!  I still have to use mine, because I have certain hardware and software that require me to use Vista on one of my 2 main PC's in the house.  I often get system crashes, hang-ups, slow-downs, error messages, etc.!  It is truly pathetic.  I really LIKE this O.S. for it's simplicity, BUT with all the problems i'm having, I can't accomplish much!  If a Microshaft executive is reading this, how about some Windows updates fixes and modifications that will make my Win Vista system work better!  We users need better support from you clowns!"

You will not be disappointed.

1,"Ideally, I would write a review for an anti-virus program after running rigorous tests to subject it to various malware to see how much it detects.  Perhaps you'll understand when I confess that I haven't done anything of the sort.  What I have done is use Kaspersky Anti-Virus for the past few years and have had no issues with viruses.  How much of that is due to the software and how much to my generally being careful about what I download, and from whom?  That's difficult to say, but I'll lay out what little I can actively see about the program.

As far as keeping me safe, Kaspersky does issue warnings to me if I start to go to a website that they have reason to believe is problematic.  I generally take the advice and steer clear of them and haven't had any regrets on that score.  The other major selling point is kind of the opposite side of that coin, namely Kaspersky doesn't pop up all the time with annoying messages that either ask me to do things or tell me that it's done something.  It simply loads in the background whenever I boot the system and quietly does its job.  I've had anti-virus software in the past that was a lot more intrusive so this has been a major plus.

In summary, I don't pretend to be an expert on determining which anti-virus software is the best.  But I use my PC for hours every day and have had zero problems since I started using Kaspersky.  The program is also very well behaved and neither tortures me with popups nor does it interfere with games or other programs as some security packages do.  To the extent I'm able to judge it, there is literally nothing I know of that I wish were different.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good no-hassle anti-virus program."

1,"There are a lot more features in this software bundle than I realized at first.  My main interest was in the video software because I wanted to make some short movies and be able to save them to different formats such as Youtube or to be viewed on a TV with a DVD.  This software helps you to capture, edit and then share your movies from your video camcorder, mobile device, USB camera or other movies or clips you have on your computer. When you start it up you see a timeline where you can capture your video or move it from a file on your computer.  There you can edit things like titles, fonts, sound, themes and the order in which your movie clips play.  You can also do slideshows or a combination of still shots and movie clips.  It's easy to do a simple movie, dragging around the clips in the timeline and adding written info or voice-overs to the different clips.  When you're finished you can save it in a variety of different size files and formats or upload to Youtube or Vimeo.  (I've never tried Vimeo).

I found the program very user friendly although a little slow at times.  There is a learning curve if you want to get into more than just the basic things.  There is a manual that comes with it but in my experience, just spending the time playing around with it was the way to go.  It's easy to make a quick movie that you can export to your mobile phone or burn to a DVD or upload to an internet site. You can also take more time and do something really creative, but still with all the bells and whistles that make it pretty painless. For example you can modify the playback speed, multi trim your video, enhance the color, brightness or sound or even add overlay clips. The software came with a manual of 213 pages of good instruction including photos of the different screens. I was also impressed with the section, including pictures, of the equipment and cables you need to connect a camcorder or other device to your computer in order to import movies. It makes it easy for the beginning filmmaker to get started. I had already installed a firewire card on this computer but even if I hadn't installed one before, the instructions, along with photos would have made it easy to do.

Like all video programs that I've used, this is really a memory hog and I sometimes experienced slowness or stalls for a few minutes when I was trying to do something.  I don't think any video app in this price range is without it's quirks and this doesn't have any more or less than other such programs.  It suits my purposes for home movies or videos to share on the internet.

Both the video and photo applications come with user manuals.  I thought they were helpful in getting me started and then the rest was mostly intuitive.  I've used other video and photo editing software, so I'm not completely new to this type of program.  I think if you've never used this type of software before you have to plan on spending some time using it and trying the different features.  I tend to learn and remember things that I use often and then look up or experiment with new features that I haven't tried before.  There is a lot more here than most people would ever need.

The Photo Editing software is also included in the bundle. Overall I like using this program.  It has lots of great editing features that are typical in this type of program, plus a few that are unique.  Using Express Lab is a great way to make quick changes to photos without having to go through a lot of steps or a learning curve.  I especially like the ""suntan brush"" feature in the ""Makeover"" section.  It transforms your cursor into a nice little brush that is like using a self-tanning cream to make the people in your photo look like they spent the afternoon on the beach playing volleyball.  OK, so you now look like you were out in the sun all day, but the exercise part is missing and you still look a little pudgy?  Use the ""Thinify"" feature and you look like you sweated off a couple pounds while you were getting that suntan.  And you use the cursor to specify which people get the magic weight loss treatment so your big fat cousin stays just the way he is!  Well, the tool's not perfect because it makes your head thinner too, and then it looks kind of bizarre, but if you just want to do a little tweaking it's kind of a cool feature.

Another fun feature of in the ""Makeover"" section is the ""Toothbrush"" feature.  You haven't used those whitener strips on your teeth in some time and all the coffee and tea makes your teeth look a little dingy in that close-up photo?  Just click on the ""Toothbrush"" button and point your cursor at those pearly whites and they become, well, pearly white!  Yeah, you could do the same thing with a paintbrush in Photoshop or even in the main section of this program, but you'd have to be careful that you didn't whiten the spaces between your teeth or your lips since you don't want to look really strange.  This program knows not to do that and just whitens the teeth.  Eyes a little red?  The ""Eye drop"" feature takes care of that with a click on the mouse.

Want to make your photo look like like one from 1839?  Use the ""Time Machine"" feature under ""Photo Effects"" and you can change your photo from today to look as though it were created anywhere from 1839 to the 60's and choose the camera it was ""taken"" with to a box camera or other special effects.  Of course you always have the black and white or sepia options.  It has tons of other features, these are just a few.  I'm looking forward to using it to create some 12 x 12 inch digital scrapbook pages.

I love using this program for a quick fix on photos and also for it's ability to organize all of my pictures.  The things I don't like are that it's a memory hog and sometimes runs somewhat slow on my Pentium 2 Ghz computer running Windows XP with 2 GB of ram.  It's not terrible or anything, just a little slow to load and sometimes doesn't execute commands instantly.  I also find the program not to be very intuitive on some features, but that could be because I've been using Photoshop and Photoshop Elements in the past and am used to those programs.  I'd still recommend this program to anyone who likes touching up or doing creative things with photos.

This bundle also includes Corel Painter Essentials 4.  With this program you can take any photo and do all sorts of special effects such as making it look like an old oil painting, a charcoal drawing, a line drawing, chalk drawing and many many more.  I've spent hours playing with this and trying different combinations of brushes and tones.  Some results were very good and others were pretty so-so.  I would say that pictures of scenery seem to turn out better than close ups of people's faces.  It takes a while to render each photo on my computer but it's fun to watch.

All in all, this software has a lot of features for the money, more than I'll probably ever have reason to use.  But it's kept me busy for many hours, most of them enjoyable.  It's not perfect, but I think it's a good deal."

1,Satisfied by this product. 5/5

1,"This program is compatible with Windows 7 and 8. You also need access to the internet to activate it online, and for online services. This program works well for burning dvds and blu-rays, but I also appreciate it for the unique Live Screen Capture feature, which is helpful for creating tutorials especially. As a video editing software, it's high quality and supports 4k ultra HD output, as well as 3D features. It also includes seventeen tracks to choose from to add music, as well as a music and speech cleaner. The Pinnacle Studio Ultimate is also more advanced than the Studio and Studio Plus editions, precisely because of its support for blu-rays and 4k ultra HD--which is important for me. Overall, I found this program to be high-quality with a ton of options to choose from."

1,"Upgraded to 8.1, worked great, not sure why people dislike 8 so much, it has been very stable and my friends love that I have tablet games now.  The metro is better long-term than the start menu because there is no hunting required.  I also now get an extra hour of battery life out of my laptop."

0,"I generally use software like this for digital artwork. I've always gravitated to Photoshop because it was really the only software available when I started. Like many have stated, the price of the software is a bit ridiculous so I'm always on the lookout for cheaper software that I can use to get the same results.

Unfortunately, even though this is called PaintShop, it's really photo editing software through and through. I knew that when I got it, I'm not saying that Corel falsely represented their software. In terms of photo editing it's very nice. The price is unbeatable. The interface is well laid out and professional looking. It's easy to use for the novice and there are a lot of features for the professional.

I would definitely recommend this for the novice photographer just starting out. It's cheap so you're not breaking the bank on something you may not stick with, but it's robust so you won't have to keep spending money on progressively better software. It has the easy auto adjustment features, but then as you get more skilled, it has all the features available for you to white balance and correct contrast and add your own artistic flare.

Digital painters, stick with PS or Painter."

0,"I've owned Mac's since the original 128K Mac and Microsoft Products have always had integration issues in the Mac world.  This version of Office is no exception.  I work a lot on PC's at work, so I'm used to that environment.  In the Mac version of Office, menus are not where you think they might be.  Some of the most useful ones in Word and Excel are still part of the Mac menu bar, though there is another Excel or Work menu bar.  Many of the formatting controls are on a separate window and in headings you would not expect.  So, here's hoping (once again) that someday Microsoft creates a truly integrated Mac Office."

-0.5,"and so when they mailed me the free software for my Mac, I decided to use it again. We have rental properties and when I started to input the information, the software quickly recommended upgrading to premium. Ok, so I did. Now, I have to ditch this whole return and buy Turbo Tax as well since it's screwed up my rental figures by applying ""real estate professional"" to one property only. It's mysteriously disallowed my depreciation.

The questions the program asks are lockstep and don't give enough straight forward help (like the other reviewer it was recommended that I read some lengthy IRS pamphlet- that's a great help-- thanks a lot!!) and it is difficult to know where it goes wrong in the interview. I think this software was rushed onto the market without enough testing. However, I'm sure that if your return is fairly simple and not 35 pgs long like mine, it works OK."

0.5,"For simple interior design projects, AutoCAD Freestyle is ideal. It's much more limited than a full 3D rendering program, but what it does it does well. Want to plan out a new living room lay-out or kitchen remodel? It's very easy to use this program to create floor plans and design layouts. It's also very easy to save projects and then tweak them to meet your needs. I've enjoyed using the program and found it to be intuitive and easy to use if not incredibly robust when it comes to features. If you're used to AutoCAD, you may not like this new 'light' version. It's similar to making the transition from CS5 down to Lightroom 2.5--there is plenty of similarity, but you'll find yourself looking for tools or options that just aren't there. For someone new to designing floor plans and the life, AutoCAD Freestyle is perfect. It makes getting a usable design as quick and painless as possible.

Is it worth the price? Unless you really enjoy using graphing paper and a straight edge, yes it's worth it, especially if you plan to do more than one design. It's a valuable tool for the do-it-yourself type, weather you're re-doing a bathroom or your backyard. Being able to save to .PDF files or .BMP files makes transforming your designs into 'digital blue-prints' easy--I sent mine to a printer to be produced on 11X17"" paper and they turned out fantastic!"

1,"I have always liked Trend Micro's security software and this is no exception.  If you have used Housecall online, you know that Trend Micro has a very capable antivirus package.  This is very unobtrusive, and has a really low CUP draw.  I ran it on a 7 year old clean laptop running Windows XP, and there was no major difference when it was scanning in computer performance.  My only complaint, really, is the 3 PC per year limit.  That will keep me with Vipre and my lifetime home site license, but otherwise, I would consider a switch for Trend Micro Titanium."

0.5,"This is my 3rd. time using H&R Block's Deluxe + State.  I waited until Amazon ran a special price and purchased.  As always with Amazon, the download was quick and easy taking only a few minutes over a 5 Mbps DSL connection.  Info from my prior return was loaded without problem.  Entry of the current year's info was simple and provided answers to any changes in tax law that might apply to my return.  No issues in return preparation or submission.  Program audits alerted to me to any possible problems that I might need to address.  Returns were transmitted easily to the IRS and state.  H&R Block kept me informed as to the status of the return.  Although I filed later than usual, my state refund was received in less than 2 weeks.  My IRS return required a payment.  A nice option with the software allowed me to submit my return and then schedule payment to the IRS later.

Compared to Turbo Tax, there are no substantial differences for me in the preparation and submission of my returns.  Both make it very easy.  The BETTER VALUE is definitely H&R BLOCK as it was about 1/2 the price of Turbo Tax.  The BEST PLACE TO BUY IS AMAZON!!!!."

0,"I'm a bit confused as to all the comparisons of Pixelmator to the full version of Photoshop.  Just by looking at the price (hundreds and hundreds of dollars) you'll know the two programs aren't going to have the same features.  The real competition with Pixelmator is Photoshop Elements, a stripped down version of full Photoshop.

As soon as I started the Pixelmator program I knew it wasn't going to be of use to me.  It lacks correction tools and the photo tweaks it does offer I can get in Elements.  I researched multiple pro and non-pro reviews of this program to figure out what I'm missing.  Pixelmator does indeed do things that Elements doesn't or lacks.  It has more filters, according to one source, and handles layers better according to another.  Neither of these are things I need - or at least I don't want them as they're presented in this program.  If you need them and you already have image correction software then perhaps Pixelmator will be a good buy.  It's certainly cheap enough.  While I'm giving this 3 stars, I do want to stress that - this is a bargain if the program gives you what you're looking for.  Essentials is also cheap, but it is about double the price.

Each photographer is different, but here's what I find myself wanting and using:

1. Image correction (red eye, etc.): I use Elements as it's usually the easiest.  I don't really need nor am I interested in the full program.

2. Artistic manipulation:  Corel Painter Essentials.  When you really want to mess with a photo, change it completely, and you want to do it fast and cheap, I've found Corel to be the best choice.  (If you're not on a budget, there are better options.)  It's not very practical, however, as there is such a thing as overkill.

3. Filters with a TRUE photographer's perspective:  Hands down, Tiffen DFX.  Tiffen makes filters for cameras.  For anyone who was shooting photos before digital they'll know the brand and they'll know the approach.  No changing your photo into mosaic tiles or other total manipulation, this program applies filters just like you would out in the field by putting them on your lens.  I don't know why Photoshop hasn't taken this approach which seems more designed by computer geeks than real photographers.  DFX is both a standalone app and a plugin for Photoshop and some other photo editing programs.

It seems like Pixelmator's market is a very small niche.  I know I'm not in their market.  But you might be.  Definitely figure out what you want and need and then decide if it's for you."

0,"Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X8 is okay. I did not find it as user friendly as I would have liked. Still working on a short film, which is coming along very slowly. Used help many times. I wish someone would make these kind of programs easy for a non-pro. Unless you are a computer geek pro and understand the language, I'd stick with Windows Movie Maker, which comes free with most computers with Microsoft. For $80.00 via Amazon Prime shipping it's a bit pricey. Hopefully after playing around with it for the weeks to come, I'll understand it better."

0,This is a typical Quicken Deluxe software that tends to have many server crashes.  Since I have installed it (less then two months) their server has crashed twice. When I contatced their customer service I got someonme in India who barely understood and spoke English and really didn't have a clue what my problem was.  The last crash lasted for 4 days. Other than that it appears to be an okay software.

1,"I do the taxes for several members of my family.  I would never use any software other than Turbotax.  Here's why:

1.  It picks up all of your data from prior years returns, saving time and effort.
2.  It walks you through EVERY SINGLE thing (if you want) which every year seems to find me deductions or angle that I would never know on my own
3.  It makes it very easy to e-file
4.  It's great for keeping back-up PDFs of old tax returns- much better than having paper all over the place
5.  It keeps you up on the latest tax information, as new updates download automatically
6.  It easily handles tax returns for 1099 only ""consultants"" and if you own rentals

What's better this year is downloading the State is easy and doesn't require a credit card like it did in the past, which was a nuisance.

The ONLY way to do your taxes by yourself"

-1,"There is absolutely no reason to buy this product.  Stick with XP and wait and see how Windows 7 does when released this year.  Vista adds some eye candy that you can get for your xp system for free or a small fee.

It does add heaches, UAC (goggle that one and check the number of problems), terrific bloat, system slow down, driver issues, software issues,etc...

Also take a look at the people giving 4 and 5 stars and then listing a host of problems."

-0.5,"The good news: Smart Surfing was easy to install and easy to configure. It can run checks on your existing files to look for malicious code.

The bad news: Although the software initially seemed to work fairly transparently, after a system reboot it kept me from being able to access the Internet using either Safari or Firefox. And this on the least intrusive settings.

The in-between news: It was easy to use Smart Surfing to check for malicious code on my previously unprotected (for years) Mac, and I was glad that it found nothing bad lurking on my drives. On the other hand, that also suggests that whatever I've BEEN doing (ie, surfing with reasonable caution) combined with the natural safety of the Mac OS, is all the protection I needed. If Smart Surfing was less expensive (and didn't bring my browsers to a halt), I might like having it as a safety net. But at this price, it just didn't measure up.

In fairness, I'll say that some of the protective features are probably useful for people who are inexperienced on the web, or who share their computers with inexperienced people. Additionally, the ability to block entire catagories of websites (like adult sites) could be useful for families with kids using the computer."

1,"A quick note. I do not work for MS. I have over 800 reviews to my name here unlike some with just 1 review.

We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. ""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again."

1,Did my taxes got a refund didn't cost too much to do did state too and everything seems to be ok so far.

1,"I loved this product! It was simple and very easy to use, install and even update! I was looking for a good replacement for my Microsoft Word software which has gotten extremely expensive in the years past so I was happy to see a similiar product for a cheaper cost! I love it! Once again, Corel has hit it out of the park!"

0.5,"When it comes to AV (anti-virus) and 'internet' protection software, I'm not normally willing to try new things. I've used Kaspersky for a few years and been very happy. Prior to that, I'd used Norton and McAfee, but both seem to have gone the way of bloatware. So, when Vine offered me this product, I wasn't really interested at first. I realized a bit later that my subscription was about to expire and that the newest version of my tried-and-true was getting panned in the reviews. (An altogether familiar tune after Norton and McAfee.) So I took the plunge.

It is fast, it seems to use fewer resources than even K2009 - and I thought that was a fast, light program. I've not had problems with it at all, though I've seen from other reviewers that the company seems to go above and beyond when users do experience issues.

One of the things about AV software is that it should make you forget it's working. It shouldn't make its presence known unless something has gone very wrong. It should be unobtrusive. Because of that, the best thing you should be able to say about a product in this category is that it works.

Vipre WORKS.

Nuff said."

1,"First of all, it is 3 ""installations"" only, not 3 PCs. Don't be fooled by the marketing tricks.

As like other virus tools, you need to uninstall old virus protection tool from your computer before installing the Norton 360 V5. Installation is exceptionally fast and within a minute or two, Norton 360 V5 is up and running.

The scans are done in the background. And it DOESN'T slow my PC while the scan is running. Computer feels the same way as it were stock. Also, it scans fast, much faster than my previous McAfee.

No major annoying popups. Only one I've encountered are ""High Resource Usage"", which I confirmed high system memory usage with window task manager.

Parental Controls are mediocre.

Norton's link scanner is a special feature. It not only tests links before you go there, but it also is capable of scanning your social media (like FaceBook) wall for links posted there, to ensure that the links lead to safe places. This is a big plus for people who are active on that social media sites. A useful feature !!

This version comes with a startup manager to help you to disable startup programs that you don't use or that you don't want to start up.

You cannot choose a disk you want to scan in a VirusScan GUI. If you want to scan just a particular volume, a folder or even a file, you can right-click on it in window explorer and choose the Scan option from the Norton sub-menu.

If there is any particular weakness in Norton360, it's the ""Backup"" feature which is very basic. And the 2GB free backup space is nearly useless. This is not a replacement for more capable backup utilities like Acronis TrueImage, or the Norton Ghost.

In summary, a faster and less resource-demanding virus protection tool with real useful add-on features. I highly recommend it."

0.5,"I will admit whole heartily that this program may be too much tech for my brain to wrap itself around. I am confident in saying that there are more than likely features in this suite that I will never even know exist.

If you are looking for a highly technical, tech specific review I'll warn you right now to look somewhere else. :-)

My first thought while installing this software was... wow, this is taking a long... long... time. I think from the time I started the install to the time I ended was about 42 minutes. And, I just bought a brand new computer in February. Granted, I didn't get the top of the line super speced out computer, but it's a pretty good computer.

For a user like me, this software may be out of my reach, or I need to take a year long class to really get the most out of it. I was able to change up some photos and create some (really basic) things. But, no where near the samples of stuff that the tutorials show you to do. I may get there someday with a lot of practice but it's not as intuitive as I would have liked personally."

-1,"This year's Turbo Tax has an annoying anti-piracy lock that won't let you print if you install it on more than one PC, so even if you want to buy it after reading the revealing reviews here, be sure to buy a fresh, factory-sealed copy, not an open package!"

1,"I have never dabbled in computer graphics or modeling before but I've been into many forms of art and I'm familiar with many of Adobe's art-type programs.  This is a very fun and relatively easy program to use.  I've been dabbling here and there for the last few days and been able to have fun creating various different models.

I'm running a 2009 iMac with upgraded memory and it runs pretty well.  I would definitely buy this program for the artistic kid out there who has some familiarity with more complex computer software."

0,ok

0.5,"In my work I run into all sorts of computer problems.  Many are caused by Spyware and Viruses.  This product will not remove viruses but it will remove spyware.

For those of you who have not had the misfortune to run into spyware consider yourself very fortunate.  Spyware comes in many forms but the most dangerous in my opinion is keyloggers.

A keylogger is a program that records keystrokes when it detects certain activities such as online banking and credit card transactions. Once the keystrokes have been recorded they are quietly transferred to the thief and used.  I have a client who nearly lost $5,000 from his bank account due to spyware.

Spyware Doctor in my experience is the best product at finding and removing keyloggers and other spyware on the system.  Most antispyware products disable the spyware but they do not always remove all of the programming code associated with the spyware.  Spyware Doctor on the other hand appears to remove all of the spyware code.  In fact, spyware doctor often finds two or three times more files associated with spyware than do competing products.

Con:

Spyware Doctor at times really slows down the system.  Particularly after coming out of hibernation on a laptop.  PC Tools is currently beta testing an update that is supposed to improve memory usage and performance.  If the free update improves memory usage and startup performance Spyware Doctor will be tough to beat."

0,"This is a great program and it is well-supported  by  Corel, but there is simply nothing new for anyone who wants to be competitive in business or compatible with the rest of the world. No longer can Corel say that WP has any features that Word doesn't. Word (and Excel) have an astronomical number of functions that WP will; never have simply because Corel's development team is so small.

I really love Wordperfect. It's fun, interesting and there is a very knowledgeable user base that can help almost anyone with anything. Plus, Corel is a great company and continues to support their customers
""Reveal codes"" is a fun little feature, but it has no real value anymore. I really like the way you can see where a typeset begins and where it ends and I do like how it enhances the use of power fields. Word's ""reveal formatting"" works in exactly the same way and provides the exact same function.

PDF functionality is still spotty at best with importing exporting and images working only part of the time. Without a ribbon interface, Wordperfect looks old, disorganized and clunky. And WP still needs the Office Compatibility pack (for Office XP) just so it can read docx files. You actually have to download thisw add-on software just to read Word files (which Corel claims are compatible out of the box). This is simply too much in a world that needs absolute compatibility with Word formats. Corel doesn't have the customer service or developer base it once had and it is clear that since WordPerfect 8, every major release has had little or no improvements over the previous versions. X5 also suffers from this stigma (as does Wordperfect X6).

In place of a real email client, WordPerfect still uses a modified  version of Mozilla Thunderbird. It seems to me that Corel should have better ability than to sell a CD product that half consists of freeware programs that users could download for free themselves. All this and Wordperfect is not significantly cheaper than MS Office.

WordPerfect's legal features are also becoming insignificant compared to Word's free legal edition plugins. That has to hurt the most since Wordperfect  still ships with standard legal templates and tools that were once considered industry standards. Perhaps some modern legal users could speak to this better than I can, but I just don't understand the attraction towards these legal features

One of Corel's claims to fame with this version of the software is the ability to repair corrupted files. This is great news but it doesn't explain why WP files are so prone to corruption. It is just much less of a headache to use a more stable and compatible program like Word or Openoffice.org to get daily business done. My advice would be to leave WordPerfect alone and buy a more actively supported program like MS Office or even Openoffice. I don't really recommend Openoffice. Sure, it's free and all that but Corel really does their best to support their customers"

1,Have been using Turbo Tax for years.  I always do my taxes for myself and family and friends.  I once tried HR Block and did not come close years ago.  Why change company when I have been satisfied year after year.

1,"A lot of features for not a lot of price, it does have a bit of a learning curve but they provide a lot of lessons and guidance on how to use each feature. If you have any background with video editing, this offers an easy step into some useful task, though not entirely advanced compared to other programs. I'd heartily suggest it for people who aren't willing or interested to jump in to the more professional programs, or are interested but they're budget isn't--but who want to have more creative possibilities than what a basic program like Windows Movie Maker or lower end/price programs. This is also a really good stepping stool for those higher end products. Get to know basics and exploration on this, then if and when you find you come to the end of what it offers, move on. The expensive programs really are overkill for the great majority of people (and I say this as someone who has the Adobe suite and realize that even as an educator I'm paying more than what I reasonably need to use).

Great middle ground software that would fit most people's needs and spark a lot of creative development"

0.5,"Corel Home Office comes with many fine features and a light imprint that allows it to be an excell;ent app for the popular netbook devices. It is clear, thou, that this product means to compete with Microsoft's Works 9.0 product. In spite of the fact that Home Office comes with a handy document map/tabl;e of contents feature, there is no reason  to buy this product over Works that retails at more than half the price. The idea of making the product only for netbooks is a serious error for Coirel and one that hurts the customer most of all. Not every family owns or needs a netbook and, since this product will not work on full-sized computers without erasing the flash drive, the home user stands to lose a lot for a hefty price of $69.99. Corel is known for  its excellent products and this is certainly one of them, a quiet excellent program that has features much beyond the scope of Works 9 and, if properly used, can provide a simple alternative to either MS Word or Wordperfect. All in all, I recommend this program for netbook users only. It more than equals Works in functionality and it intuitive interface. Check out the Corel site before buying this.

0.5,"Whilst trivial, the one item I liked the most on this issue of ULEAD is the  capture capability from DVDs through windvd 8. This output file was generally a bmp, and MEDIAONE editor allowed a file to be converted to a smaller file with the same quality.
The Central testing area I used is the capture area, since it has the most widespread use in media. There are 7 tools in the Capture Video Tool, and I took a music track and inserted this audio track first. Then I placed a selection of Pictures and movie files from Various sources (such as Windvd 8's capture feature, and the sample media I can gather from other DVDs) and defined the time sequences for each photo or media( The ability to  extend the picture duration out, as well as the video works well in this medium).And after the projext is complete, you can output the project to a pure digital file, or to a DVD using the system. ULEAD can capture from any digital source, and output to any digital source. About the only additional thing I would use is the free application ""Quick Media Converter"" which makes various media files available to ULEAD, as well as from ULEAD.
ULEAD makes the basis for an excellent digital editing system , and in this package the bonus of windvd 8 Silver makes for the best viewer of digital output... the audio quality alone makes the whole thing totally worthwhile, and wether you use it with Bought DVDs or DVDs you mixed down yourself, the audio quality is superb."

0.5,"This is my 21st review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: A fierce blizzard at a Wisconsin ski resort has Nancy Drew holed-up with a handful of vacationers. She is on the trail of a missing journal of Marie Antoinette's that would lead to a sacred treasure hidden by the ill-fated queen back in the 18th century. Her sanctuary was the Chteau Rochemont in France relocated & rebuilt by a chocolate milk tycoon in America.  I found it generally interesting to be able to explore the monstrosity that was the castle, but later became irritated by the tasks that had me zipping all over the place with a clunky interface.

INITIAL SCORE: 88

CHARACTERS:

Dexter Egan: This was one of the more interesting characters that HER has ever produced as it showed the light and dark side of a man growing up as an adopted child by the millionaire, Ezra Wickford. Ezra had such affection for the boy Dexter [spelling bee champion, volunteer work during WW2 era]  until he felt he could no longer trust him with his future estate based on criminal fraud convictions. Great plot line and I loved the two journals in the secret study!

Jacques Brunais: He was sappy right from the start! I was very surprised that HER had the character end relations with Nancy on such a horrible note, but I actually LIKED that story derivative!  It showed the live emotions of irrational people [like in real life].

Lisa Ostrum: Usually when a shady past is shoved in your face early in the storyline, that is a sign that this isn't the culprit.  I had Lisa pegged as my # 1 suspect only because the other characters were pressed into showing their flaws throughout the adventure too thoroughly and I had reasons to think they HAD problems, but they weren't directly related to the vandalism. Tara V. Smith [who voiced Lisa] did a fine job, but it sounded rather cartoonish also [like a Peanuts character] and I found it hard to take this photojournalist seriously.

Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss: God, this woman was something else. I loved the HER comedy bit with the fifty chicken legs and probably would never had done most of  the chores she asked out of shock she would ever impose this on me.  I doubt I would have been so forthcoming with her as the ND did, because she was just as much a suspect as anyone else there.

Ned/Bess/George: The voice actors [Claire Gallagher & Maureen Nelson] sounded like they were reading scripts because half of the dialogue didn't flow naturally, but the written dialogue did make me laugh.  Lani Minella actually laughed in this one which is a rare event in ND games. You can check her talent out on a youtube video I recently found! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm1BGVfqWC0

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
The score was an excellent rendition of a classic, upscale French Society in the Age Of Reason.  It's light, lilting works trickled along amidst fine backings from harpsichords & strings.  The sound effects were adequate and the castle scenery was a solid job by the designers for the year it was made.

CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 88

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: I didn't find many in the game except locker combinations, lever & slider puzzles, but it was okay for what the game provided. Uniqueness and mini games would come in later ND editions.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87

ADVENTURE ENDING: The way the culprit was caught was rather odd and unsatisfactory. I was confused on what exactly happened and scoffed at the simple and unexplainable way I had to catch them. Perhaps some French punishment should have been introduced :) instead. The climax in the Royal Tower was spectacular on a visual level and again you had to pay close attention to Nancy's notes regarding what happened to everyone in the conclusion.  BTW: How is Nancy able to bounce around the castle in a good mood after being knocked unconscious hours earlier? Seems rather ridiculous to me.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me two days [7 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 82

My Strong Points: I guessed the culprit and have been on quite a run lately [14 correct out of 21 games]. I seemed to assimilate into the plot pretty well without being fooled into believing any side story that would skew my detective work. The puzzles were simple to complete and I noticed that similar puzzles were placed in later games.  I was able to deduce that I had to start the ski lift in order to be saved from the cold weather!

My Weak Points: A walkthrough was used only a couple times just to check my game flow because HER had a sloppy time integrating the ""incident trigger tree"" properly.  In layman's terms, I completed tasks a couple hours ahead due to my prowess only to find out later that the character was still wondering how to do the SAME events just accomplished by asking other people!

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 86 + 82/ 2 = 84 [ B ]

BOTTOMLINE: I saw more written dialogue glitches [Bess [I believe] said ""someting"" instead of someTHING]. Overall, I learned only a bit more French history than I knew already, but for children, this is a fine starter education of European society.  I recommend it for that, but compared to the future games, it was rather simplistic.

Thus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, TREASURE ranks.... # 5 !!!!!

0,"This product does what it should do.  The reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 5 star rating is due to the constant upgrade notices to try and get you to buy a more expensive product!!!

Thinking there was a conflict somewhere, I tried everything to fix it.  Finally, I bought additional RAM from Amazon and replaced two 512 Mg memory chips with 1 Gb chips.  Problem solved.  Notwithstanding that Microsoft advises a minimum of 2 Gb of RAM, I suggest not running Windows 7 unless you have at least 4 Gb.  Memory is cheap.  It only cost $20 to upgrade.  However, be advised that some software that ran on XP will not run on Windows 7."

1. Cant import income in bulk.  In other words, if you have an excel file with 500 expenses, (with date, description, and time), youll have to type in each item individually, doing 1,500 entries.  Barf.
2. Cant paste what youve copied from elsewhere
3. They hide too much.  In other word, in most cases, they don't allow you to see all of the things youve already put in so that you can easily change it"

Now certain programs won't launch, those that do seem slower.  I'm not certain that reinstalling the software that won't launch will be sufficeint to solve the problem.

I don't reccommend this software.  Fortunately I had backed up my data files to an external hard drive, so if I have to reinstall Windows I've not lost my irreplacable photos.  What I ahve lost is hours and hours of time, time that I would have perfered using to create my digital art instead."

1,"After an audit in 2006, we really needed to keep our records in order. It is one of the biggest business chores you need to stay on top of. Especially for solo small business owners.

Although everything was in order, keeping track of all those receipts, invoices, vendor records, ect... was absolutely overwhelming. Especially when you are trying to run the daily operations of your business.

Trust me when I say, ""being audited is no fun and is a scary thing to go thru"". We were lucky to have gotten a a good agent to deal with and was enough patient with us. This is definitely not the case with most.

I do like this software very much, but the software is only as good as the one who is inputting the data.

Installation was simple without any issues. We upgraded from the 2009 Pro version. However, we are still running older versions of other software because we trust them and they work for us... so far.

The file attachment feature is great, mainly because we can attach receipts and invoices to individual accounts and helps pinpoint our expenditures and operational costs, i.e. fuel, motel, food, vehichle repair and maintenance, etc...

Although this is a new install, only 2 months, thoroughly, we have not put it through the ringer yet. As we are progressive in using more of the features, we will update our review.

Overall, I am completely satified with this software and hope that it will be a functional tool for our record keeping. Because an audit is a huge distraction, causes much mental anguish, and is terrible waste of valuable time."

It employs the most accurate available technology that allows to track up to 3 laptops, PCs, Android phones and tablets (devices) by providing their location to be viewed online especially useful in case of their loss or theft.  However, the location can be inaccurate, if GPS and Wi-Fi were unavailable. The tracking can be stopped and it can be uninstalled after successfully logging as the device's administrator, but that may not be easy. A photo of the thief can be taken using the laptop's webcam, but the feature is useless in desktops lacking cameras.  A file protection is not provided. Inferior to some competitors."

1,"I have been through the lot! THIS IS THE BEST COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY SUITE I EVER HAD! And I had them all...(well, almost)

For years I sweared by NORTON - until two years ago it got so heavy and demanding it slowed my computer to a crawl. Then I gave McAFEE Internet Security a try which, although lighter, pestered me with pop-up messages. When that license expired I gave KASPERSKY Internet Security a try: real secure feeling and detailed settings control; however, a number of internet applications, although given full internet access, were slowed to a trickle.

About a month ago I downloaded the AVG INTERNET SECURITY as a 30-day trial. Not two weeks had passed and I decided that THIS IS THE ONE!

Light, heuristically effective (it even found a malware that KASPESKY failed to locate - and KASPERSKY has the best reputation on cleaning out everything!), no conflicts, email integration (although not with ThunderBird yet, a minor glitch), excellent AI and quiet.

It may seem a bit pricey, yet keep in mind that it comes with a 2 YEAR license, not the usual 12 months that most other Security applications come with.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

0.5,"I used the Windows 7 Home Premium first as an upgrade and then as a clean install.

UPGRADE

As an upgrade from Vista Home Premium, it was seemless. I first used Windows 7 Adviser (download available free from Microsoft) to see which version of Windows 7 is right for me. One cannot upgrade willy nilly from any version of Windows to any version of Windows 7. Then, I used Windows Easy Transfer to migrate my data to an external hard drive. I don't think I needed Easy Transfer for the upgrade from Vista, but it came in useful later, when I had to do a clean install.

Upgrading went very smoothly. I retained all my software and settings. I really loved how easy it was.

WINDOWS EASY TRANSFER

It may interest some of you to know sysprep will not work on a computer with an OEM version of Vista with a paid upgrade to Windows 7. I could not even perform a Windows repair with the full version disk. Nope. Once I changed out my motherboard and CPU, I had to use this full version to do a clean install, after which I ran Windows Easy Transfer. Windows Easy Transfer did not restore all my software or even my email settings, but I did give me back my wallpaper.

CLEAN INSTALL

I had to do a few clean installs: the first time after upgrading my motherboard and CPU, the second time after upgrading my hard drive (cloning the old drive failed and my disk backup image did not work). I know, I should have done it all at once.

The first clean install was flawless. The second clean install was fraught with problems. Windows would not let me repair nor do a clean install. ""On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT disks."" Lots of googling to solve this problem, and I did not find anything like what I finally did: I went to the ""advanced"" screen of the Windows setup screen and deleted all the partitions. That worked.

WINDOWS 7 VS. WINDOWS 8 AND VISTA

Compared to Vista, Windows 7 is very familiar. It feels stable. I haven't had it lock up or anything. I like the taskbar on the bottom of the screen. I like being able to see small screenshots of my work by hovering over the icons there. I like anchoring my most used software there.

We do have Windows 8 at home and I chose not to upgrade to that. Windows 8 is very cluttered and clunky. Everything takes far too many clicks, like taking a roundabout route just to turn off the machine. I consider Windows 8 a downgrade.

Yes, I do like Windows 7. It's very nice -- the best Windows system to upgrade to at the moment."

0.5,"Bento was released by the makers of FileMaker Pro with a very specific purpose. Interestingly, Bento was the name given to a layer in Apple's visionary OpenDoc architecture launched with System 7.5 in the mid 1990s.

Bento is a personal (as opposed to ""enterprise"" or networked) database that's meant to be as easy to use as the Mac itself. It has a carefully-identified set of features. These run parallel to those of iWork's Pages and Numbers. It could have been called i(Data)Base to aim at a comparable niche in the market. Bento complements Pages and Numbers nicely. The criticisms that some users (and reviewers) leveled at Bento, that it lacked, for example, scripting, Automator and network support, miss the point. It was never intended for those sorts of uses - or those types of users; look at FileMaker Pro for such extended power.

Bento was specifically designed and released without such features in order to concentrate on the less-experienced consumer and SOHO user. Some missing areas of functionality might be useful to the non-specialist user. On the whole, though, the balance between price and feature set, not to mention features, means that Bento can be safely recommended.

Bento is designed to accomplish everyday tasks using a pleasing and straightforward template-based interface The very fact that it is simple, has only one window, and just the right number and design of a few uncluttered menus adds to its accessibility and effectiveness as a flexible and powerful tool.

It only takes a quick glance at the lively, comprehensive and very well supported and moderated Bento forum to see how easy it is to achieve sophisticated date calculations and many-to-many implementation; Bento's apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Bento Users is another useful site. The documentation that comes with the product is excellent.

Everyday
FileMaker has compiled a list of some of the more likely projects that Bento can handle. These include:

* what FileMaker, Inc. calls ""virtually unlimited"" contact details
* coordinating events, parties, and fundraisers
* tracking projects, assignments, and deadlines
* prioritizing tasks; Bento has been used successfully in a Getting Things Done task management context
* inventories, donations, and items for sale
* track hours worked, payments due, invoicing
* rate service providers and sellers
* libraries for music, movies, and media
* store files and photos related to projects and events

and, rather cryptically, since this ought to be part of any good data model:

* connect related information together to see more details.

There are ample standalone products to achieve many of these tasks - Project Managers like OmniPlan and task management - the same company's OmniFocus. Bruji's outstanding BookPedia and CDPedia. There are dedicated time management and billing/invoice suites like TimeNet Pro - though none without some flaw; and iPhoto, Address Book and iCal themselves, with the last two of which Bento integrates closely.

It is what it is
So the criteria for MyMac's evaluation must not be, What's missing from Bento? Rather, how well does this reasonably-priced and robust Leopard-only product do what it's been designed to do?

First and foremost, then, is a courageous - and largely successful - attempt to make database design and management accessible to those who are not specialists or experts in such software, but who still have demanding needs such as some of those just mentioned.

Bento's main window consists of three panes:

The leftmost pane is the Source List of all your data Libraries. Libraries are Bento's top organizational level - like iPhoto 7's ""Events."" One Bento Library is for one set of data or project. Under these in the Source List are Bento's Collections; these are like iTunes' Playlists - subsets of the data in the Libraries. Then Smart Collections behave just as you would expect: they're Views updated in real time and as your filter criteria - or the records that matches them - change. You might, for example, want to create a Smart Collection of all unpaid invoices - as they get paid, they disappear; or of all unsold artifacts in a craft store - as they are sold, they disappear.

The records area is in the middle and is the largest pane. Data can be presented as a form (an individual record) or table of as many records as will fit into the space. You can have more than one form for any Library (each may display different fields - in different orders). This is emphasis on the user experience again; it drives the way you work. Each view is satisfactorily editable - columns can be dragged horizontally for display; you can chose which you will view too. The principles, of course, are analogous to those in FileMaker's ""Align"" routines and fit well with the sophisticated controls that Bento offers.

The Associated fields list for each Library is on the right. Fields are created here and dragged and dropped onto the Records area. There are only three attributes for each. There is also control over how many of these three panes will appear - you can focus on what you're doing.

This is a familiar interface; and it preserves the metaphors for data handling on which Bento rests. Similarly, searching, sorting, and summaries are all swift and intuitive. Searching can be very sophisticated and saved as a Smart Collection.

Note, though, that this means that there's no concept of separate datastores in Bento. All the data which you use Bento to maintain is managed in one place. You can still share Libraries with other users. Yet if you organize your data according to ""domains"" within your life (household, work, hobbies, friends, you may find it a disadvantage to access it all in and from one place by launching the Bento application itself as opposed to separately-located data files. On the other hand, this is very much in keeping with current Mac practice: it is the way that iCal, iPhoto, iTunes, iWeb (though not Pages or Numbers) all work. More evidence of the perceived target audience; for them it is assumed the task in hand is more important than file names, file management.

Data Types
Given these intentional restrictions, the substantial variety of data types (nineteen of them) which Bento handles is impressive: basic text, numbers, dates, drop-downs, Booleans, graphics, sounds, movies, ratings, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses and more. There's also a FileMaker-like calculation field which can, for example, concatenate text and multiple fields values as well as perform simple mathematical operations. Inevitably there will be some function missing for someone, but on the whole it's comprehensive - and very easy to use.

Templates
For all its transparency, Bento is not a glorified Wizard. Fields can be controlled - use drag and drop. Fields are rearranged and resized with the mouse - usual Mac style. Some positioning and alignment of text is possible using a toolbar - though probably less than most people will come to want: five text sizes, no choice of fonts. One of the biggest hurdles that the marketing of Bento has to overcome is to make it plain that these are flexible means to an end - although the (new) user's first contact with the program will be the 20 templates that come with the software. These templates are shells; they are not one and the same as the data which they are used to present. If the designers of Bento have understood just what it is that a majority of users want in terms of the payoff between interface and ease of use as opposed to in depth functionality, then they have surely got a winner on their hands. The number of downloads (a quarter of a million) in the first few months since Bento became available suggests that is the case.

Address Book and iCal integration
By default Bento has Libraries for contacts, events, and tasks. These are the same as those in Leopard's Address Book and iCal; they are not synched. Although these Libraries can be removed - ""Disconnected"" - from Bento in its ""Home"" menu, to do so is to lose access to those applications' data. What's more, to edit in Bento - or worse delete - data that's derived from Address Book and iCal is to lose it directly from those same applications actually outside the Bento environment. Integration is tight: you could drag and drop a set of contacts from the Address Book Library right into Bento's Source list to create a Collection. This ""disconnection"" could usefully be supplemented by a preference letting you work from a duplicate and/or advising you that you could conceivably lose permanently (unless backed up) data of which you might have thought you were only working on a copy.

Import-Export
Bento supports only CSV (Comma Separated Value) for import and export of data, although there are ways aplenty to convert that after or before the fact. So that's a limitation only inasmuch as you may need another utility and two steps. The importer is drag-and-drop then Wizard-based and worked very well in testing. The Wizard asks which values from the file to be imported should correspond with which fields in Bento.

Relations
The way that Bento handles relations - the fields in other tables whose data you need to appear in the current one - is one of the program's main limitations: it's not a conventional relational database. But, again, it's an approach designed to give the greatest likely desired power with the simplest steps.

In your ""local"" Library you create a field of type ""Related Records List""; then you indicate from which Library you want to use data. Dropping that field on your form displays a small empty table corresponding to the ""remote"" Library. You click the ""Add related records from a list"" icon at the bottom of the inset table to see actual data. Bento displays the corresponding list of records from the associated library. Changing records in the one changes them in the other. Deleting a record in the ""local"" Library only deletes it only from the Related Records List (the ""local"" dataset) and not from the associated Library. This more closely follows the practice of removing a record from a Smart Folder, Collection or Playlist. It's a way of preventing mistakes - although not entirely logical, until you're used to it. It's also another example of ease of use; accessibility takes precedence. Note, too though, that Smart Collections cannot include data from related tables. That may be a significant restriction for some.

What is likely to be a real drawback, though, is the fact that by ""Related Records"" Bento means essentially a ""Portal"" to all the records in the ""remote"" Library. There is no concept of a ""Join"" using Primary and Foreign Keys. This means that you cannot be selective in the way you relate and view such records.

Conclusions
Bento is a package. A compromise. MyMac's advice is that - after reading this review - you match what it can do against your needs. Almost certainly you may have requirements which Bento seems unable to meet. But look closely. Sure, its interface is user-friendly - and more important, perhaps, Bento itself is easy to use. But this doesn't mean it's in any way crippled and ""less than"" comparable databases of this level of complexity - relational features aside.

It's much closer to Pages, Numbers, iPhoto, iTunes in feel and scope than it is to FileMaker. But prolonged use for this review has revealed that Bento can easily be made to do more than might be apparent even from glancing familiarity with the delightful sophistication of the interface.

Given some of the things that Bento can do, there's a remarkably high ratio between effort and result. Whether or not it's for you will depend firstly on whether you have Leopard. Then on your data handling requirements: total size of data set, complexity of relations and perhaps the way (or whether) you use iCal and Address Book. Then you should decide whether one of the absent features (scripting, full control over template fonts, a missing calculation, say) rules it out.

For many users the extremely pleasing appearance of Bento will be a winner. How nice to be able to work in a fully Mac-like environment using an inventory of - car parts.

A balance has been struck: users with complex, evolving and intricately relational databases may still be best with FileMaker Pro. Those for whom the lure of an elegant user interface is important and/or who want a direct equivalent of Numbers, Pages and iPhoto/iTunes and/or seamless integration with iCal and Address Book should look seriously at Bento. Download the trial, use it carefully and draw on the many sources of online help, remember its very reasonable price, decide whether you'll be able to make Bento do a variety of things for you larger than the dedicated software mentioned at the beginning of this review can do - and see!

Pros: the interface - it's good-looking, simple and easy to use; many data types supported; integration with Address Book and iCal; templates work with many types of file; works with iPhone and .Mac

Cons: the interface - the changes you can make to its appearance are somewhat limited; poor relational capabilities; mass updates to records not supported

Great improvements have been made in Access 2002 which is now much easier to use than its predecessor was, even easy enough that a novice user could figure out how to setup a basic database with little problem. PowerPoint 2002 also features some nice new transitions and other ""bells and whistles"" to help make your presentation look more professional. For those of you who may have created Binder files, in previous versions of Office, this feature is no longer available, however an unbind feature comes with Office XP. The downside that I have heard much about is the dreaded Product Activation. If you work within your license to use Office, you should never have any problems. My computer gets worked pretty hard, and I often have to reinstall Windows. Needless to say, Office has to be reactivated. Never once has MS staff refused to activate my product. This ""torment"" is really more dreaded than most users will ever find it to actually be. Be more productive with a copy of Office XP today!"

0.5,"Overall this office suite is excellent.  A word of cautiuon for those who use Excel for Scientific and technical work: Visual Basic(entire suite) and the Analysis Toolpack have been removed from Excel 2008.

-0.5,"I wrote a review of this product a few months ago that dinged it pretty hard. I had purchased it, tried it and shelved it. I took it off the shelf after someone challenged me to try working with it and to review it again. Well, not much has improved in my thinking. A few things are a little more convenient (after you get accustomed to them) but overall the program is a drag on time consumption and ease for writers (authors). The 'ribbon' is okay, but it takes up room so in the end I dump it (hide it) and work without it until I need to use it. I convert books to eBooks and at that time the Ribbon is okay, but not more efficient than Microsoft 2000, actually making hyperlinks in 2000 within a document or to the Net is a ton easier in MS Word 2000 than in this version. For some reason Microsoft must have felt that hyperlinks should be made as difficult as Adobe makes them in InDesign. MS Word 2010 provides a neat image compression button for Web use and eBook use but does not resize them, so in the end I use Photoshop for that. BTW, you can resize the image for your local printer, but that does not resize it for the Web or eReaders. IMHO, 2010 is better than 2007 but fails to improve on Word 2000 and is therefore, just another change for marketing purposes and not necessarily for those who need to create material. I have Microsoft Office 2000, Word 2003 and Word 2007. I dumped 2003 and 2007 (uninstalled them) and now use MS 2000 for the bulk of my work. I have kept MS Word 2010 installed, but find that I don't gravitate to it, simply because my time is too valuable to put up with the geeky stuff.

Edit December 19, 2012: I have now had MSWord 2010 for about 8 months. For writing copy, books, etc. I still prefer MS 2000. For making eBook files for others I use the MSWord 2010. A few updates have helped with hyperlinks, but that's about it. The picture compression is handy for making eReaders like Kindles, Nooks, and other EPUB and iBook files. MS 2010 does open all older files and you can save them in the older version format if you need to. But I confirm again that MS 2010 costs too much labor time to switch copy writing or the writing of books and other large documents from 2000 to 2010."

0.5,"I recently upgraded to this version of Quicken from Quicken 2010 Home & Business. I see very few changes that are not purely cosmetic. Although many users have complained about problems with Quicken 2013 Home & Business, I am not experiencing any obvious difficulties (except for one that I'll explain below). On the other hand, I am not doing anything particularly demanding. It's possible that I would be running into problems if I were using some of Quicken's advanced features.

The one difficulty I'm having stems from a change in my credit card number. I had previously linked Quicken with my credit card account. I received a new card with a new number. Quicken made me deactivate the account before it would take my new information, and when I reactivated the account and downloaded transactions, I wound up with a number of duplicate entries that I had to delete.

I've long used Quicken to track my finances. It has its quirks, flaws, and annoyances, but if there's something else out there that does the job better, I'm not aware of it.

Bottom line: If you already own a working version of Quicken Home & Business, you probably don't need to update. If you own a ""lesser"" version of Quicken and need the business features or you don't own Quicken at all, you might as well take the plunge."

1,"If you listen to a lot of radio, then no doubt you've heard about these companies who offer online computer backup for an annual fee. But why do that when all you need is this software? And it's so flippin' easy to install and use, I can't imagine anyone who wants the assurance of recovering their invaluable computer info NOT getting this. You'll be glad you did!"

-1,"I recently purchased a new PC from Dell, and I bought this software (from them) along with the computer.  Owch, what a mistake, I should have read the reviews here first.

I had pretty low expectations/requirements from this software actually.  Mainly I just wanted to move over my settings, email, and music.  How about 0 for 3!

Firstly, the software can only be used 1 time (owch!).  That is their ridiculous licensing agreement.  Second, you need to install it on both the machine you are moving from, and the machine your are moving to.  Alright, so I'm moving from a windows xp machine to a windows vista machine.  Surely that's got to be the most common configuration these days right?  Surely that's the one thing that would work right?  wrong.  Firstly, the installation crashed on *both* machines.  After downloading updates from the web, re-installing and uninstalling several times it finally seemed to install correctly.

Smooth sailing from there right?  Nope.  First, I tried to do the transfer over ethernet, since I have a home network and that is supposidly supported by this software.  That didn't work at all.  So then I grudgingly tried a transfer over the cable that they provided. The software had a lot of trouble recognizing the cable, but after fiddling with that until it worked, I finally set up a transfer.  Several hours later, my vista box had developed major problems, none of my email or bookmarks or anything had been transfered (only documents) and I was one cheesed off customer.

This software is completely (and I mean COMPLETELY) worthless.  It's a waste of your time, and a waste of your money.  Believe me, the way to go is just to get an external hard drive and drag the files over you want to keep, or do it over your home network if you have one.  You'll save yourself a lot of time and a lot of headaches doing it that way, believe me, I wish I had."

0.5,"I have not used a speech to text product in some time, the last being Dragon Dictate for Windows from a few years back. This is the first version of Dictate for the Mac that I have used, but the products are similar in how they work.

My goal is to have a way of transcribing voice memos I record with my iPhone. I went through the set up procedure, skipping over the part where it asks you to create a nuance account as part of registration (I guess I will be prompted to do this again later).  For training the software I used a voice recording I made of something I had previously written. It requires 90 seconds of audio to work; I gave it a 2 minute piece. The first pass during the training had a lot of errors which I corrected. The software then translated the voice recording and it still had quite a few errors. I tried again where I made a concerted effort to speak slower and more clearly. This second effort rewarded me with a better translation, but still with errors that I had to edit. I then tried a third time, with a different text, and this further improved, but still with errors.

I then switched gears and tried the voice transcription from a live recording. First I used the included USB microphone. Surprisingly, it worked a bit better, still with errors but fewer. I then tried recording with a bluetooth headset and it worked about as well, so it is the way I will go from now on.

My conclusion is that it is probably unrealistic for me to expect 100% accuracy. If I am focused on good diction and pacing, I can improve accuracy. Using a good audio source with minimal background noise is likely a necessity. The microphone in the iPhone may not be of high enough quality, although I am going to continue to try this route, since it is primarily what I am interested in using the software for. I see potential here, as I have continued to see improvement. I would like for the software to be able to take multiple sample audio files with corrections and use that to improve accuracy. But I think it will continue to improve with time."

0.5,"This was the first Learn by Video series course that I've used, and I'm very impressed with the production.  For the most part I'm impressed with the content too, although the introductory level was frustrating at times.

The course provides a good introduction to the  CS5 user interface, the Flash tools, file types, and managing the timeline.  There's also a very basic chapter that introduces ActionScript (AS3), which is the coding language used to create complex logic in a Flash application. The AS3 material is extremely basic--too basic in my opinion.

Again, I like the production of this video package. The videos can be played in Windows, Mac, or Linux. There are also MP4 versions of the video files, in case you want to view them on a portable device (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, etc.). This is helpful if you want to view the videos and work hands-on on your computer, although the small screen would be difficult.  The DVD also includes a collection of asset files that correspond with the lessons.

If you are a visual learner or don't prefer thick technical books, then this video course would be a good low-cost alternative. Don't expect to be a Flash expert when you complete this course, but at least you'll understand the basic concepts."

1,This 2015 edition follows the very good performance I've had with Norton Security for many years.  I recommend it highly to everybody.

1,"GUEST REVIEWER - ! MRS. KNOW IT ALL ;-b

This is a great product to use if you are interested in documenting your family history.  I have always been interested in my heritage, and this software makes you want to learn more and more.  I think just having the relationship with the elders in your family and hearing the stories is fantastic, but documenting them for other generations is best thing you can pass on.  The print-outs you can create are great to share with family and display.  I got a two-week subscription to ancestry.com for FREE with this product and I suggest you get all the information you can from the site while you have the free service.  I suggest this software to help you start learning more about your family history."

1,"I did my research on this product and found it to be exactly what I was looking for. I have run out of space for additional cards on my system and this card combines USB 2.0, Firewire, and RJ45 onto one card. Great card and Amazon had the best price that I could find online."

1,I bought this item a week ago to share the printer on two machines. There is no problem in setting up this network server. I have an old hp office jet printer which has parallel port; I connect printer to usb 4 hub by cable which has on one end IEEE connector go to printer and other end is usb which is connected to usb 4 hub and hub is connected to arkview server. Software of arkview easily recognize the printer. I attached other usb flash drive. It recognize it too. I installed server on two computers. It is working good.

0,"Avira Internet Security 2013 is developmentally dated, but still an effective blocker against the penetration from the Internet that does not visibly slow down the system except downloading e-mail under the sluggish spam filter. The ""Do Not Track"" part of the browser toolbar, which not everyone may like to have, protects from being tracked. The free ""SocialShield"" add-on helps parents to track the children's social networking activity. The included backup system works only, where the Avira is installed, and disallows online storage.

However, the Avira may sporadically remove needed Windows files and not prevent entering a clever identity stealing Web pages. Its firewall is simplistic, and parental control - primitive. Its looks is lacking simplicity and clarity of the competitors, but surprisingly it costs more than them."

0.5,Upgrade worked as described; comes with both 32 or 64 bit disk; installation went smoothly; no great changes from Vista but XP users will see significant change; like the new features.

1,"Roxio has been the Classique audio as well as video, editor that excels at its tasks in so many respects. Since version 4 even the basic editing features have been the bte
noire of this classic program. Up until versions 11 and 12 it appeared that the makers of Roxio Creator have played around with the configuration of this excellent product
sometimes to its own detriment. The current owners Corel have packaged Creator NXT with paint shop Pro making this an invaluable purchase for anyone wanting to edit pictures
video and audio.
 The structure of the software follows the traditional format that Roxio has always done which is to base the home tab with all of the capabilities. I found that this
was a good way to start, and an easy way to incorporate the new elements; Corel has obviously learned from some classic software blunders and they have kept the essential
structure of a great program. The picture capabilities as well as the video capabilities are very advanced. I easily found the classic capabilities of editing photos, editing
videos, and many parts of the program that I've used in versions up to seven and eight of Roxio Creator. As someone coming from the older version where Roxio did primarily
audio tasks and a collection of video tasks, the additional capabilities take a little getting used to but in the format that Roxio works virtually all of the tasks can be
picked up easily, either through general use or the help section they call the learning Center. The additional capabilities look very similar to some of the Avid software that
I have used, but they have the generally easier format which Roxio brings to the party. Special mention to the CD and audio creation section, which has some excellent
capabilities: one great advantage in the audio section is the ability to turn vinyl into excellent digital files, and you can do that with a Roxio product all with some
general cables that you can get at Amazon. As the case in the audio section, the ability to process and enhance audio files is superb. The disc burning section is fully
compatible with CD, DVD, Blu-ray in all respects: the tasks it can perform I once again high-value, but they have that same Roxio ease of use.
 I'm not a big fan of their card, poster, ""Hallmark moments"" type of cards, calendars, however you can take pictures of any kind, edit them for maximum effect, even
brush up old and damaged pictures, to make some eye-popping pictures and calendars.
 Whilst I have found Roxio NXT to be generally useful and thoroughly amazing, in-line with my previous experience with Roxio, my main suggestion about service and
support is that if you want to do something do NOT call the so-called help and service number, what some people used to call product support for Roxio. I attempted to use the
convert file to video DVD function and found that I had to call the support number, or should I say email ultimately, since the product support numbers require a convoluted
series of numbers just to get you to the starting point where they will refer you to a useless webpage. About the best thing I can suggest with the copy and convert section is
that you look up in the learning Center to find out what can be converted to the main type of files. The main issue I have with support is that the MP4 file I wanted to
convert was all I was asking about, and it took days for support to work out that my question which I repeated in each email was something that the convert subprogram did not
do. This is not a big issue when you consider just how many types of files that Roxio NXT can deal with, and it is quite a lot, but I really got to the point that I felt the
so-called support technicians did not know their product. Anyway, my verdict is that the program is excellent, it does an amazing variety of tasks and it has that classic
Roxio ease of use: and if you really want to it has a very easy to use interface with the cloud, not that I'm recommending use the cloud :-)."

0.5,"Family Tree Maker Deluxe is the latest and greatest from the company that has made its mark on the world of genealogy. Just like with the other software available from Family Tree, this software helps you build a tree, create reports, integrate with Ancestry.com, and otherwise learn more about yourself and the individuals with whom you share a common ancestry.

This version of Family Tree takes some time to install, so you might be best off just walking away from the computer for a while as it loads. If you already have an Ancestry.com account, it will take some time to import the data. About 15 minutes worked for me, and my family tree has about 8,000 members. At this point, everything is set- you just use the report tab to run reports and utilize all that the software has to offer.

For those who do not have an Ancestry.com account at present, it is easy to start building a tree. You just enter your personal information along with that of your spouse, plus parents, grandparents, etc. The software will then work its magic and start looking for matches in the database. It provides hints to review and research further, if necessary, to make sure that the hint for that person is correct.

Like other Family Tree Software, this version comes with a free membership to Ancestry.com. In this instance, the free trial is for three months, but I should caution that with this version, you have to enter a credit card number to activate the free offer. This means, of course, that you have to remember to deactivate before the end of the trial, otherwise your credit card will get charged. This is less than ideal, I admit, but it is a common way of doing business nowadays with online services.

Discovering more about ones ancestry can be fascinating and Family Tree Deluxe is a good product for this purpose. It does take a little longer to download and there is the credit card issue mentioned previously. But other than that, I found it to be a good, reliable software product with useful reports and other tools that help you expand your family tree in all sorts of new and fascinating directions."

1,"This product is amazing.  It is simple to load without any bugs and seems to block everything to date.  I've had it installed for about 4 months and have no complaints whatsoever.  We have tried many antivirus software packages and this really, along with ZoneAlarm, seems to be the best."

-0.5,"I was moments away from purchasing this at a retail store even though the only feature I really wanted was the ability to burn HD-format video onto a standard DVD (obviously with less time per disc due to the much smaller storage size). This was the number-one touted feature on the box (and on the Amazon website). I didn't have my reading glasses with me and almost missed the itty-bitty 2-point type down at the bottom that said that this feature was only available with a separate purchase of a special plug-in only available from Roxio. What the crud? This is SOFTWARE, not a mechanical device... if the software doesn't support the feature it advertises, then IT""S NOT A FEATURE... the plug-in is a separate software product and they should not be able to advertise it as part of the parent application! This is one of the most misleading cheats I've ever seen. At least on the web-site they don't hide it in 2-point type, you just have to follow the asterisks. If it's still worth it to you, and you don't mind rewarding deceptive marketing practices, the plug-in is available at the Roxio web site for twenty bucks extra. Let me know how it works, cuz' I ain't buying it."

0.5,"I used to keep a Windows machine running after I switched to Mac, just to keep using QuickBooks. The full version of QuickBooks for Windows is a godsend for small businesses, with just about every feature every small- to medium-sized business needs.

The Mac version is pared down, though. I'm not going to go through all the features it has and doesn't have. For a business investment like this, you really need to go look at the full list of features yourself on the Intuit website.

What I wanted to impart here, though, is that QuickBooks for Mac 2013 provides an easy, intuitive bookkeeping interface and it's very fast. No chugging through calculations or report generation. Everything I've tried pops up very quickly and accurately. You can customize report forms easily--both for data and for look. You can easily track multiple accounts. It doesn't do payroll--go to Windows for that, or use an online service.

I use QuickBooks now to manage my own freelance business as well as the finances of a small nonprofit organization I run. It's easy to set up invoices and create product or service entries that track to specific types of income or expense lines. It's easy to mark the invoice paid when the check or online payment comes in. It's easy to keep your check registers up to date. And, of course, you can wrap it all up and just give your QuickBooks file to your accountant at the end of your fiscal year and he or she can import all the data and take care of your filings.

Simple and fast. Just make sure you check the feature lists online to be sure it does what you really, really need."

1,"The seventh in the series, these games are relatively inexpensive yet provide hours of gameplay. In them, Nancy Drew, the college-aged female detective, explores mysteries and finds solutions to various puzzles.
You can see the various improvements in this latest entry. The graphics are much smoother, and as you turn around in a given area the 'snapshot' quality is more of a flow. It's still not a fully immersive environment - in essence you go ""to"" a spot and then can turn left or right through set images of the room. You can point to a ""hot spot"" in the room to approach an item or examine it. Still, in a way this makes it easier for younger detectives to know what to do. If you can't click on something, it's not important.
There's no violence or blood, although I do have to comment that the ghost dogs are rather scary! I have had younger teenage girls refuse to play some of the games I've lent them because they were too scary after a few hours. This one might fall into that category if you have a skittish nature. The dogs don't actually attack you, but their jumping on the doors, howling and rattling the house can be quite frightning.
The game uses very logical puzzles that actually teach you things. You want to test water from a well, but first you have to learn the real technique for priming a pump and do it. You need to use a motorboat, but the pistons aren't in the proper cycle positions. Anyone who uses a boat would see this by looking at the engine, and they helpfully include a diagram to show you (i.e. Nancy) how to fix this before the engine will work. Notes at the ranger station warn you about Hantavirus, a real danger if you're cleaning areas where mice live.
There are other puzzles - identifying birds, finding planks to get over rotten floorboards and so on - that fit in as well. In general the game does an admirable job of keeping the game very realistic-feeling, like you're really at this Pennsylvanian lake, amongst the locals there, exploring their world.
On the downside, much of the game involves pony-trail sorts of handoffs. You know you need a spark plug. You might think it would be lying around nearby or that one would be in the house. But instead, searching all over creation finds none. Instead, you have to go to sleep, wake up at night, chat with someone who it so happens has one, go back to sleep again, and then in the morning use it. It can get extremely frustrating when at many times in the game you know what you *need* but just have to figure out how the game designers think you should *get* it.
Still, many times this means that your gameplay time is stretched out as you wander around, explore, chat with people, and enjoy the world. It's not a game for people who want to race through to the end to have 'beaten it'. If you poke at a walkthrough site, you can probably do so in an hour or two. Instead, it's a game that, for a relatively low price, lets you wander through a well realized world, exercise those ""little grey cells"" in your brain, and really become knowledgeable about a number of intersting subjects. Give yourself time to have fun with this one!"

0.5,"This was my first time using Quicken. I mainly use it to track spending in my checking account, as well as my retirement accounts. It does have the capability for tracking investments, mortgages, etc., but I was mainly looking for a way to track my spending.

It was easy to install and for the most part, is intuitive to use. I use a password to update my accounts which only takes about a minute or so to do. Initial imports required a lot of manual categorizing, but Quicken adjusts to how you want things categorized and all following imports required little manipulation. Of course, sometimes I have to go back and re-categorize transactions, but it doesn't take up too much time.

To me, the spending reports are invaluable. I can see exactly where my money goes - last month, last 3 months, etc. It's a great way to start some budget planning and beats tracking expenses manually. Like I said, there is a slew of other capabilities, but for me, even using it for my limited purpose is worth while."

0.5,"I was wary of trying this when I saw all of the bad reviews, but after buying and using it for 4 months, I don't regret purchasing it.  True, it seems a little disjointed, but once you remember that you use the program by using the top menu bar and do your navigation that way and through the little windows on the screen, one gets used to it.  But remember, this software wasn't written for Leopard.  I had no problem what so ever using it."

1,"Ive been using TurboTax since it was first published. Some years I find fault with the program but most of the time it just works. My major complaint is the self-advertising for an endless array of other paid offerings, but I seem to be not even noticing them anymore.

 Since Intuit makes only incremental changes and my tax situation is not complex, it seems to take me a few minutes less each year to complete my taxes because I know the parts of the program I need to use.

 A lot of people have complained of price increases for the program and being forced to buy different, more expensive versions. I find no reason to complain.

 TurboTax has a slight learning curve for new users, but if you follow their guided input and are willing to read the directions (both Intuits and the IRS), everything gets done.

 So TurboTax 2014 looks and feels a lot like TurboTax 2013 and 2012, 2011 and years before that.

 And thats a compliment. I use TurboTax every year because it works. Its that simple.

-1,"What a nightmare. If you've read the other reviews here, you probably already know how annoying Vista's access control messages are, and how it was incompatible with nearly everything, so I won't spend time railing about that. The one issue that I could not solve, or forgive, was one of the most fundamental issues for an operating system: file handling.

Vista didn't like copying files across a network. In fact, Vista took personal umbrage at being asked to transfer files across a network, and passive-agressively reduced the transfer rate down until it could be measured in bits per minute, instead of kB per second. I soon came to personify Vista as one of those toad-like elderly women behind the counter at the DMV who take perverse delight in watching people's impatience boil into homicidal rage. The kind of person/operating system that will let you get to almost the front of a two-hour line/95% complete file transfer and then wordlessly put up a ""Next Window"" sign/""File I/O error"" message with just the hint of a malicious grin. The kind of person/operating system that justifies the ""No Firearms in the DMV""/""Don't keep a hammer near your laptop with Vista installed on it"" rule.

The problem wasn't just limited to network file copies, either. Copying photos from a USB flash drive to the hard drive took so long that I could have recreated them in MS Paint, pixel by pixel, more quickly and with less frustration. Where else but in Vista will you see a dialog box with the words ""0.2 of 4 Mb copied, 240 hours remaining""?

My experience with Vista was so abominable that I swore never to give Microsoft another dime of my business, walked to the Apple store, and plunked down way to much money for a Macbook Pro. OSX has its issues, some of them serious, but OSX makes Vista look like Microsoft literally implemented the ""1,000,000 monkeys with 1,000,000 copies of C++ will probably turn out a well-made operating system"" rule, but decided to save money by giving about 200 monkeys 3 computers and one copy of Q-BASIC."

0.5,"There's not a whole lot more to say about this Norton product. I've been using Norton for year. Even back in the day when you could buy one license software version and without having to pay for a new version each year, you could just download updates. Long gone are those days. The stickler part of this is that we need protection for our electronic devices. I will say, that last year I paid $80 for this software from the Norton website, but I purchased this download from Amazon for only half that price. Keep that in mind when it comes to renewing your virus software."

-1,"If Quicken 2011 is anything like Quicken 2010 it runs like a 7th grade science project. It misses transactions, the interface is confusing, the screens are amazingly amateurish, account lists take several tries to assemble themselves. I could go on, but any of you who own the program, know what I'm talking about. With the loss of Microsoft Money, Quicken is the ""last man standing"". Too bad that man is walking wounded."

1,"I agree with the earlier reviewers about the myriad positive features this upgrade brought.  Faster operations, better stability, exciting new features (e.g., batch bill pay, ability to handle options - finally! - auto balancing, better portfolio views, etc. etc.), and still a great price.  Even without the rebate, this is a worthy upgrade.  BTW, CompUSA has the lowest price I've seen.
The only gripe I have with Money is the still confusing interface, esp. for the new Money user.  I've used it for 3 years now and sometimes I still can't find what I'm looking for.  Luckily, the Help's search function is VERY useful and always locates the functionality I need.
Highly recommended."

-0.5,"I don't ""hate"" this product like some reviewers here. I think the software is decent, the price is not too bad, and it has a neat control panel. In other words, if you've been using Trend Micro for years, and it works for you - I'm not trying to talk you out of it.

The problem for me is, I don't know why I would ever be compelled to buy it. It's inferior to the free options out there. So if you're looking for the best protection, there is no single option that will cover all your bases. But fortunately, the best rated programs are all free.

Here's what our IT staff recommends:

* For Anti-Virus: Either AVAST or AVIRA. Both free, both fairly equivalent in protection, in speed, in program size, etc. They will give you some annoying popups asking if you want to upgrade, but the basic home version is both adequate & free.

* For Firewall: If using Windows XP, 7, or Vista, just enable the Windows Firewall. In tests, the Windows Firewall does as well as others. Never run two firewall programs, as this can cause problems. If using an older version of Windows, use Zone Alarm (also free). Also, your router acts as a secondary firewall (even if you only have one computer hooked up).

* For hijacks, redirects, popups, & malicious web sites: Use HostsMan. This tiny little program (also free) amazingly keeps a list of malicious sites and prevents them from loading on your browser.

* For emergencies: Install these programs just in case - Spybot Search & Destroy, C-Cleaner, & Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. Run C-Cleaner once a week - to keep your system running optimally, to clean up unwanted files, and clean your registry. The other two programs are to run just in case you have a problem, and it's super handy to already have them on your computer in case a virus or hijack is preventing internet access.

So I can't really recommend the Trend Micro, but I'll go ahead and share my experience with it:

-Install was a nightmare process, slows down boot time, bulky program.

-I really don't like the free online backup, because you are forced to renew every 12 months. In my opinion it's a marketing gimmick to get you to renew, when there are many options out there which are better (and free). For important files, I back up manually on Google Docs. For bookmarks, backup on Google Bookmarks. For backup of everyday programs and files, there are about a dozen reliable (and light) programs out there.

-Does not block some of the malicious sites, hijacks, and redirects out there. Instead, make sure you use HostsMan.

I hope this saves you both money & time. Good luck!"

1,"I have been using Kaspersky products for about 3 years now and was due for a new program as my licence on the 2011 program was expired, so i thought I would try this version which is more of an internet focused rather than an all inclusive.  For me this I hoped would be a compromise between the pop up type software and those that seem to do nothing until your already infected.  As it turns out this is my favorite Kaspersky version I have tried.

So this is a simple install on Windows 7, and it will put an over sized Icon on your desktop that looks like a little computer. It shows a green screen when all is fine and red when your attention is needed.  It has a plethora of features including mail, file, and web anti virus but also application control to limit  a programs ability to web surf or update without you knowing.  It has Firewall and network attack as well as more commonly needed features like Anti banner settings.

I can't say I have had to try to remove a virus or been attacked by one, but I think that is the whole point of using this type of software is to avoid the problem in the first place.

I can say that I like the easy interface and the way this software simply does its job without bothering me.  That in and of itself is a key feature for me.

So I do recommend this software will say I can't find a con to mention. So with that I have to say its 5 stars."

1,"I was terribly excited to receive this box of software; French was my first language now long-forgotten, and I've been aching to try my hand at picking the language up again. On TV, Rosetta Stone promises users of its products that they will be comfortable with any of their language courses in short order, citing their use by the US State Department, the US Army and others.

Well, time to give it a try. The yellow box's contents were a User's Guide, the usual assortment of user agreements, registration cards, a Quick Start guide, a small pamphlet on setting up the included USB headset on one's computer and of course, the software DVDs (one application disk and three language disks, one each for French levels 1, 2, and 3) along with Audio Companion CDs that serve as a complement to the software course--supposedly, these will help you practice what you've learned in the software and is meant to be played on a CD player or downloaded (as they put it) to an MP3 player.

In itself, impressive set if a little overwhelming, but I found the instructions rather straightforward and easy-to-use. Just following the instructions in the Quick Start guide was enough to have me operational on my within the hour. The headset installation instructions were equally as easy to follow on my Vista PC and there's even a French QWERTY keyboard overlay. The folks at Rosetta Stone have outdone themselves in this regard. There are far too many instances of software installation and use that get in the way of the software itself.

So, how did I find the software and did I learn some French? I admit freely that I was a bit skeptical about the company's claims. No grammar workbooks or textbooks, just what they call a ""natural"" way of learning through something called Dynamic Immersion, which sounds like being kicked off the side of the pool into the deep end, only less pleasant! Their admonition is to simply trust the method as it works without requiring translation. They promise that I will be speaking French immediately from the first lesson and that was no joke.

The levels are broken into units which are further subdivided into core lessons, focused activities and finally, a milestone. The program starts with a few questions about the user's goals which can revolve around both speaking and writing the language, just writing or just speaking. The recommended default is to focus on both speaking and writing, which is what I chose.

From the ""home"" screen, the user can see their progress along the lesson, the unit and the entire course. It's truly easy to use. The content is also incredible: you will either type responses, listening to and repeating after a speaker (which is scored as well) or choosing the correct answers from multiple-choices or typing out the proper sentence. In so doing, you find yourself picking up on vocabulary, proper pronunciation, writing and grammatical structure.

I have finished the first level and I'm looking forward to the second level as it is easy, but hard work if that makes sense. I haven't yet listened to the audio CDs, but if the software is anything to go by, my god. I am so impressed with the quality of the software and instruction that I am giving Rosetta Stone French the highest recommendations. Five, extremely deserved stars."

0.5,"Microsoft Office is one of those ubiquitous apps that most computer users will run into at some point, and many people (too many people?) spend the majority of their professional lives in front of one of the apps in this package. I know - I've been living with Office since before it was called Office, and one form or another is installed on my Macs, my Windows PCs - even my iPad.

Microsoft's business - like many software companies - requires the recurring revenue of an ongoing series of upgrades and enhancements. Problem is, at least a decade ago, the Microsoft Office apps became good enough that Microsoft started running out of new feature ideas most people would see as valuable. I use Word a lot, and I doubt I make use of more than 20% of what it's capable of. And at the same time, if Microsoft were to create a truly revolutionary new Office product, the tens of millions that are comfortable with today's products would need retraining. So Microsoft is stuck between these extremes...on one hand, the current products are probably more capable than most people can use, and on the other hand, you need to evolve but not change too much lest you alienate today's customers. This makes any upgrade tricky.

Okay, with that background in place, here are my impressions of Office 2016 for Mac...

First of all, I want to be clear that I am *NOT* reviewing a free copy. Where you see ""Vine Customer Review of Free Product"", I'm actually reviewing Office 2016 Home and Business that I purchased separately (indeed, due to some sort of error, I never received my keycard from Vine). I don't believe there's any difference in the software - no matter how you get it, the apps are the same.

That out of the way, one of the first things the typical user will want to consider is exactly what Office apps you need and whether to buy an individual license, or whether to pay for an Office 365 subscription. To me, it's usually a no-brainer: choose the Office 365 subscription. It gets you up to five copies of Office on your choice of Windows or Mac PCs, or tablets and portable devices, as well as future upgrades at no extra charge. To me, this sounds like a more cost efficient way to get Office, especially if you have more than one computer (say, a Mac and a Windows PC, or an iPad).

And speaking of the iPad, one of the things I like best about the newest release is that the big Office apps run really, really well on an iPad these days. Unlike older releases where Microsoft pretty much just provided a viewer for the various Office document formats, the current release is nearly as powerful as either the Windows or Mac versions. If you're one of those who spend your life in front of the various Office products, you can now realistically think about replacing your PC/Mac with a tablet and not surrendering any major functionality. Of course, you can take advantage of the mobile versions of Office without necessarily needing to upgrade your PC or your Mac, but if you find yourself using the latest versions on your iPad, you might want the most similar things on your Mac.

Back to Office, I would agree with many of the reviewers who suggest that there's generally not a hugely compelling reason to upgrade from Office 2011, with these exceptions:

1. On more modern Macs, the new Office seems to run faster and take better advantage of multi-core processors. On my recent MacBook Pro (with the quad-core i7 and 16GB of memory), Word, PowerPoint and Excel are notably faster and more stable than the prior release. The opposite is true on an older iMac I have - there, Office 2011 seems to run notably better.

2. If you use both Windows and Mac a lot, I find Office 2016 to be an easier transition across the two platforms, especially if your flavor of Windows is Windows 10. I share documents across the iPad version of Office, Windows 10 and my Mac, and for whatever reason, with Office 2016, I spend a lot less time thinking about the odd little platform-specific ways to get things done.

3. If you must use Outlook for email, the version on Office 2016 is about as good as it gets. It's not always easy to integrate outside mail accounts (gmail, for instance requires you to setup a totally different ""app password"" for Outlook), but once you do this, it's quite good. If you're at a corporation that requires Outlook as an email client for getting to the company Exchange server, finally you don't feel handicapped by Outlook. Of course, things like preferences in email clients are highly subjective, but I'm finally to the point where I'd rather use Outlook than browser based email or Apple's built-in email client.

4. The Office 2016 version of PowerPoint seems less buggy and more stable overall. For example, I have presentations I save in PDF format in Office 2011 that just come out corrupt - wrong fonts, wrong layout, etc. With Office 2016, these are perfect so far.

There are some limitations in Office 2016. For me, one of the big ones was using Word to generate form letters via an ODBC database connection to a MySQL database. This didn't work great in Office 2011 (indeed - it's one of the reasons I keep a Windows PC around!), but it doesn't work AT ALL on Word 2016. I suspect the issue is compatibility problems with the underlying database drivers, but this ""just worked"" in prior releases.

Also, one example of an annoying ""feature"" is that there seems to be an odd interaction between Word and Apple's Time Machine in this release. Every 10-15 minutes, Word comes to a standstill while Time Machine runs. In fairness Microsoft has a few articles on how to prevent exactly this problem, and I'm sure it's just something like a temporary file being locked by Time Machine while Word is trying to use it, but I very rarely see this sort of thing in other Mac applications - not even in Office 2011.

There are tons of other enhancements, but these were the big ones for me. The rest seem to fall into categories of ""oh, isn't that cute"" to truly useful to completely annoying. The good news is that if you must, you can have both Office 2011 and 2016 installed at the same time, which is how I'd recommend you make the transition - at least initially.

Bottom line is that I believe Microsoft has made good progress on bringing all the Office platforms together, and so if you find yourself using Office on all sorts of different computers, then upgrading to Office 2016 on your Mac will be a good idea. If this isn't you, and you're totally happy with Office 2011 (or whatever prior release), then I'm not sure you'll see any drastic differences by upgrading. There's risk to upgrading - and risk to not upgrading - so this gets to be a personal decision that will depend on your preferences and requirements."

I love the fact that although kids love playing it and that they think of it as a game, it is very educational and helps them with Physical Science, Logic and reasoning, Problem Solving, and engineering. It is a very nice game and worth getting. I would highly recommend this."

1,"I highly recommend Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security 2012.  For most users who don't want to work with advanced features or settings beyond the recommended settings, Trend Micro Titanium has been slightly simplified over the previous Internet Security version from past years. It's fast in scanning, it doesn't slow down my computer while I work, and the way it communicates reports to me is clear and clean.  I love it.  I'm using an AMD Phenom triple-core PC with 8 GB of RAM, and Windows 7 64-bit version. Installation was simple and quick, lasting about 5 minutes.

Even for the advanced users who like to tweak the settings, there are a good number of settings you can tweak.  You can choose if you want security software drivers to load as soon as the computer starts (for Extra Security), only have main drivers load at startup, or have drivers load after the OS has completed loading (for Extra Performance).  You can also set a password to prevent any changes to the Trend Micro software settings.

There are two tools:
Parental Controls and Data Theft Prevention.  Both easy to get to, setup, and turn on/off.

There are four main menus:
Virus & Spyware Controls: containing ""Scan Preferences"" and ""Scheduled Scans""
Internet & Email Controls: containing ""Web Threats"", ""Spam & Emailed Files"", and ""Network""
Exception Lists: containing ""Programs/folders"" and ""Websites""
Other Settings: containing ""System Startup"", ""Proxy Settings"", ""Password"", and ""UI Skinning""

The Web Threats above seems to work with Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. No mention of any other browser. UI Skinning allows you to change the look of the main console.

I've been using Trend Micro for about 4 years now.  I've tried Kaspersky Internet Security, McAfee, Norton 360, and Computer Associates before I started Trend Micro.  I prefer Trend Micro over all of the others because of the speed of installation, the ease of using the software, and the ease of uninstalling, if necessary. For me, it runs quicker than the other internet security/total security packages.  But I don't use Trend Micro exclusively. I like to sample different security packages to see improvements companies make in their products.  Kaspersky works second best for me. I used McAfee recently and that worked quite well, but I still prefer Trend Micro. 5 stars."

0,"I have to hand it to Microsoft for Office 2008's ease of installation. Usually, when I purchase any sort of Microsoft product, I'm stuck dealing with all sorts of ridiculous issues and errors before I even get to try it out. With Office 2008, everything installed without a hitch and I was able to start using it in no time. As far as functionality and features go, this one is hit or miss. I've had no issues with PowerPoint or Word, which are the programs I use the most. Excel, on the other hand, is mysteriously missing features that are integral to the overall usefulness of the program. This is baffling, and there really is no excuse for it. Thankfully in my case, Excel isn't a necessity, but if it's something you'll need to make use of, you might want to reconsider before purchasing Office 2008."

1,"I am very satisfied with the purchase of this wireless router.
The setup took just a few minutes to complete the setup wizard and after that everything worked from the first time, perfectly.
I have now wireless connectivity throughout the whole house. The connection is stable and the speed is as advertised.
I considered Linksys and Netgear routers, but there always was some kind of problem with them.
I have not found any complaints with this 3Com router. Also my personal experience with 3Com products was another factor for my decision to by this product.
Bottom line - if you are looking for reliable, easy to use router this product is for you."

0,"A lot of products currently are coming with the option to install extra junk automatically selected.  I assume most people know to deselect this junk before installation so I'm not knocking off any rating for the junk that Nero would like to give you.

Nero 2014 packs a lot of products into this single collection.  This can make it difficult to find the functionality that you want.  For example I figured I'd try recoding a CD to MP3s to play on my portable player, you'd think ""Nero Recode"" would do this task.  No, it doesn't, ""Recode"" says it doesn't recognize any of the files on the CD.  I managed to find under Nero Express a tab for the ""extended area"" where I found ""Save Audio Tracks"" which does this process.  There is a long hesitation as it loads the dialog box, which I assume is it going out and querying the Internet for the track name data (no option to skip this check).  People who like simplicity might like Nero as it doesn't allow you to get into all the fine details of MP3 settings (you just select from a list of 19 preset options) but people looking for a power tool may be disappointed.

The Video product worked okay.  This is one of the few products I've found which can easily and without fuss read the VOB files on DVDs (no, it doesn't break copyrighted DVDs) but it is slow (as are most tools dealing with huge amounts of video data) and unresponsive at times (if you trigger it to do something there is often no way to cancel so you just have to sit and wait unless you wish to crash the program).

Once you are familiar with it, Nero should get the job done like it always has, but the first few times using it, you'll likely be stumbling around."

1,"Have it plugged into my wan/router so people visiting can use both WiFi or Bluetooth.. Especially handy since some of my customers have PDA's that only have Bluetooth built in. Also have several GigaBytes of MP3's for download, and those work fine on both the PDA's and phones."

1,"I'm liking this.  I lost entirely too many goodies when my last laptop crashed, so (for me) just the peace of mind of having things backed up is worth the reasonable cost of this product.  Pretty simple to set up.

I will note that the item I recieved and the item pictured are somewhat differed.  I did not recieve a box or a disc.  The item I recieved was not ""frustration free"" packaging.  It's a card (like a gift card and has the code you need to set up the account.  It's in one of those annoying-to-open blister packs.  However, the packaging is sized nicely for a stocking stuffer, etc."

0.5,"Roxio's Creator NXT 2 is a program that is relatively easy to learn and use, and it performs a LOT of common tasks. And it performs most tasks very well. I have been quite pleased with it. And while single task programs would likely give you more individual task options, and be able to perform its specific job a little better, this multi-task program does and will perform all of its duties to a satisfactory level for the average user.

However, with that said, if you are in fact a power user and/or a perfectionist, you may want to instead get single task programs for best results. But, of course, this will come at a much, much higher overall price. But again, for most users, this program will definitely yield satisfactory results. And without being really difficult to learn, as is frequently the case with individual task programs.

Overall I have been very happy with this software suite, and cannot find any significant flaws with it. And in fact, I have only been able to find minor shortcomings. But they're shortcomings I can live with given the very reasonable price for the number of tasks it performs. If you're an average/casual user, do give this software suite a try. I am reasonably confident that you'll be happy with it."

0.5,"This is a tough product to review. On one hand, WordPerfect Office offers a powerful and very capable alternative to Microsoft Office. As multiple reviewers have already noted, if you really care about a document's layout the ""Alt + F3"" ""Reveal Codes"" feature is pretty much worth the cost of the purchase.

But the X8 version is not really all that different from the last version I used (X4). And what new features have been added pretty much apply to the Standard or Professional version of WPOX8 and not this one (Home & Student). At this point, I have to add that the ""Home and Student"" edition reviewed here is NOT the same as WPOX8 Academic (more on that in a bit).

So what does one get for $99 (Amazon price at the time of this review)? You get the essentials and they are: the WordPerfect document processor (equivalent to MS Word), Quattro Pro spreadsheet (equivalent to MS Excel), Presentations (equivalent to MS PowerPoint), Lightning (equivalent to MS OneNote), and the AfterShot 2 photo processing app. That's it, but that's probably enough for most folks. (Interestingly, Corel offers a stripped down version of this product -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Office-5-3-Installs/dp/B006N1Q0W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Office 5 - 3 Installs</a>&nbsp;(essentially, the Corel version of MS Works) - and I can't help but wonder if, at $30, Corel is hurting WPO sales by offering Office (though I suspect Corel hopes Office will be a stepping stone to WPO)).

For me, the sweet spot (as it pertains to features is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-WordPerfect-Office-X8-Standard/dp/B01EB06R10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel WordPerfect Office X8 Standard</a>. But for some reason Corel puts it out of reach by pricing it at $250. I guess there must be some logic, but I'm not following. If you can qualify for the Academic Edition that's the way to go. For $80 you get WPOX8 Professional (which adds the Paradox database application) for less than this Home & Student Edition. Disappointingly, the Perfect Authority ""table of authorities"" feature is an add-on (at $199) for the Standard and Professional versions; perhaps even more disappointingly, Perfect Authority won't work with this (Home & Student) edition.

If Corel really wants to keep a foothold with the ""next gen"" of users it HAS to update the interface; the software still looks like it did a decade (or more) ago. Frankly, this looked good when WFWG 3.11 was the current OS (and that was 1993)! What with folks moving away from WPO years ago and now folks moving away from the desktop/laptop entirely, Corel has got to do something to refresh the look. Even the free, Open Source LibreOffice has updated its look. It amazes me is that it's the cheaper, less capable product - Corel Office - that uses a MS Word ribbon interface that is far more modern and user-friendly (to the eyes) than WPOX8. So if Corel believes WPO can survive because lawyers still like the pleading and authorities features, okay. But I think it is ultimately a losing strategy.

WordPerfect, despite its looks, is - I believe - a superior product to MS Word (if it matters to you what your document looks like behind the scenes). I have used both since the late 1980s and know that you can do more with the former than latter. Quattro Pro is equally as capable as Excel at most basic tasks, but the world is Excel-based (so most work in QP will have to be ""translated"" for use in Excel). Finally, I think Presentations is a better presenting app than PowerPoint, but once again, the world is PowerPoint-centric. Of the three, the least difficult to transition output over to an MS Office-centric world is WordPerfect (which is fortunate as WP is the reason I think most people buy this suite). Even if this is the case, don't discount the other two: I learned spreadsheets on QP and found it a bit easier to understand the concept of spreadsheets on QP than I did on Excel; same with Presentations (easier to use initially; which is kind of a hoot considering WP's long-standing reputation of having a steep learning curve!).

After Shot 2 is a full version photo editing/adjusting application. I don't do a whole lot of work with photos so my impressions are those of an amateur. But from all appearances it appears to be a comprehensive, full-featured app. It is, however, 1 version behind; the most current version is 3.x (which you will learn about when closing version 2 and being shown an offer to upgrade to version 3 for $49.

One last thought. Usually ""user help"" is an after-thought; the mind set these days seems to be that if you can't figure it out, do an internet search or buy an after-market book. It's pleasing to see Corel not going that route; the Corel Reference Center utility is superb.

Summary: 4 stars. Functional, powerful, capable, at $99 you get a great program at a reasonable price and one that doesn't require an email account to activate and keep active. A 5-star bit of software. But it looks so, so, so old; WPO is in drastic need of a facelift. And the features added to make WPOX8 better than previous offerings is slim. The old look and minimal reasons to upgrade earn -1 star. So while I really want to support Corel's latest edition of WPO, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I think the optimal way to go (if you can't get the Academic version) is either to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordPerfect-Office-X7-Standard/dp/B00JC5Y6WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordPerfect Office X7 Standard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Wordperfect-Office-X7-Home-Student-Product-Key-Card/dp/B00YYCI98K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Wordperfect Office X7 Home & Student - Product Key Card</a>. At $140 you get a more powerful suite in WPOX7 Standard than WPOX8 H&S and don't really miss anything for $40 more than WPOX8 H&S. If one decides to go the H&S route, WPOX7 Home & Student comes in at $40 and is essentially identical to WPOX8 H&S (but less than half the cost). Like I said, not sure I'm following Corel's pricing strategies; to me, Corel has to do something if it wants WPO to remain a viable product. Anyway, take a look at the attached comparisons downloaded from Corel's WP web page...(couldn't post .pdf files so screenshots will have to suffice; I also posted a screenshot of this review in progress so you can get a glimpse of the interface)."

0,"Imagine a flu shot that made you feel sick for several days. On the one hand, you wouldn't get the flu, so you wouldn't get some of the really nasty complications that sometimes come with the flu. On the other hand, you'd still get about as sick as you would with a normal flu.

It's the same way with this virus program: It slows down your computer just like most of the trojan horses and spyware it prevents from being installed. However, it will prevent the rare occurrence of some really nasty viruses.

There are other, better options out there for viruses that are faster and less invasive. I have used the free version of AVG antivirus for several years, and my computer is fast and has never had a virus infection that I know of. Installing this program slowed things down."

0,"I'm having a hard time finding a good fit for Cyberlink's PowerDVD 13 Ultra software in my home. I ordered this software to specifically use in my home theater setup that includes a 65"" Panasonic Plasma, Denon AV receiver, a WDTV Live Hub, PS3, and a networked PC running a raid array containing my DVD/video library, music, pictures and the like. This is my first interaction with PowerDVD since the early 2000's when it came pre-loaded on my Compaq desktop. Clearly Cyberlink's intention is to make PowerDVD the centerpiece of your home theater experience. This software is complete overkill if you're just looking to playback Blu-ray's, DVD's and do some streaming on a laptop and is really geared toward the serious home theater owner.

--------------------
SETUP:

Installing the software on my Windows 7 desktop is about as easy as it gets and is standard fare. Pop in the disc, follow the on-screen guide and finally use the included product code to register the software with Cyberlink. To their credit Cyberlink actually included a full manual in the box with their software which is something that is becoming increasingly rare with software. This makes looking up features, answering the, ""what does this button do?"" questions very easy. After setup and launching the software it performed a quick scan of my hard drives and indexed my media files as well as presenting a number of video tutorials about the software.

--------------------
FEATURES:

Oh boy, there's a lot to cover here!

First, I suppose is the myriad of supported movie formats including: BD-R (various specs), BDROM Profile 2.0 (BD-Live), BDROM Profile 5.0 (BD-3D), AVCREC, AVCHD, DVD-Video, DVD-VR, DVD+VR, VCPS, VCD, SVCD, CD. There are even more supported video formats (I'll list some of the more popular one's only): AVC, AVI, DIVX, H264, MKV, MOV, MP4, MP4V, MPE, MPEG, MPG, TIVO, WM, WMV. Music formats include: AAC, AC3, ADTS, APE, AOB, DTS, FLAC, M4A, MID, MKA, MP2, MP3, MPA, OGG, RMI, WAV, WMA

For a full listing of supported formats (movies, video, music & pictures): [...]

TrueTheater HD:
Cyberlink touts this as their DVD upscaling and Blu-ray enhancing software. I've used various upscaling DVD players over the years and the effect here is similar. Don't expect Blu-ray quality out of TrueTheater and honestly I'm okay with regular DVD 480p quality for my older movies.

TrueTheater:
PowerDVD features a variety of other enhancement features like TrueTheater Motion that tries to smooth video by enhancing the frame rate. TrueTheater Stretch that stretches a 4:3 frame to 16:9. TrueTheater Denoise & Stabilizer that are geared toward home movie takers. In short a lot of features that you may never use unless you are really, really into tinkering with video quality and getting the absolute most out of your videos and movies.

For my uses I focused more on the ability to playback Blu-ray discs, video files on an internal raid and external NAS. With these functions PowerDVD performs fantastically.

--------------------
POTENTIAL BLOAT:

There is a lot to this software. So much ""extra"" stuff that I'm tempted to call it bloat. YouTube, Flickr and the now standard Facebook plug-in are alive and present here. I have no interest in connecting to Facebook on my home theater as I already have a myriad of devices that do the job better. The YouTube integration is admirable but still works better from a browser. Flickr is the interesting feature in the chance that you store a lot of photos on that site and like to view them on your PC/home theater.

I also did not utilize the 3D or the 3D conversion of 2D content features as it's not something that's appealing to me. Similarly I did not try out the 4K features as I don't have compatible content.

Cyberlink also offers apps for Android & iTunes compatible devices that allow you to stream content and have basic remote control functions. Again a feature that I didn't use because of redundancy with apps/programs that are already in place in my home.

--------------------
Closing:

PowerDVD is really geared toward someone looking for an all-in-one solution and doesn't want to bounce around from different media players for different content. For folks who already have established processes and software that you use and are familiar with PowerDVD will offer less value and thus be a harder buy at its premium price."

I would give it five stars if not for ONE major issue - which may affect many people in the mid-Atlantic States. It will affect you if you live in one state and work in another. That is because H&R Block Deluxe gives you ONE state return. You can PURCHASE additional states at the ridiculous price of $39.95 per state. This is more than the Deluxe (Fed and Stare sells for). So, be aware of that so you won't get any surprises.  Also be advised that the software provides for free efiling for FEDERAL but there is a charge to efile your State Return.

When they charged $19.95 for any state over one, I was giving them 5 stars. But now that they have gotten greedy, I've lowered it to four stars.

I hope you found this information helpful.

1,I really like this software.  It's very easy to use and very fast.  I recognize the need for keeping your hard drive clean for more efficient use and in the past have used several producst to do this.  WinCleaner allows me to do all that with just one product.  After you install it you can configure it to do what you want it to do.  From that point forward you just have to remember to click one button to run the software.  Works beautifully and keeps my 4 year hard drive running smoothly.

1,"I've always thought Nero was more geared toward the tech geek than the casual/novice user.  They're moving more towards also helping the novice, but in this release and updates available for it, it supports burning AVCHD video to DVD.  This is the format my digital video camera produces in HD, and very few applications were supporting it when I purchased this program.

I've never had it hang or crash on me.  The only draback is that it likes to take over displaying every image, quick time, windows media and other file types if you let it.  Just don't let it.

Otherwise, burning CD's and DVD's is simple and easy with Nero.  Upgrades and updates always keep you on top of new stuff. Often, the updates are free."

-1,"UPDATE to review, 2/12/13: yes you CAN make MS Office 2002-2000 run in Win7, if Win7 is previously installed.  I just installed both on my Dell laptops (Lat 6530 and 6510) which I just bought in January.  In PC World, they maintain you can also install those same MS versions in Win8, but I'm so antagonistic to Win8 I've not installed it, yet.  Original review follows below.

==================

Imagine, if you will, the annual How-to-Alienate-the-Customer Meeting in Redmond, Washington, aka 'upgrade' plan, for MS software.

Ms. Snippy (proudly):  Well, we've redesigned the interface yet again, just like aisles in grocery stores, so the customer will be confused, feel stupid; so will subscribe to our paid help.  Yet we added a cute dog to slow the search process, make it harder to search than prior;  we also reduced the number and types of files search can read, and made the Indexing Service more annoying.  We also forced the interface colors to glare blue and glare white, to increase eyestrain. Thus we can truly call this product 'new'.

Mr. Fleece-the-Customer Project Manager (smiling):  Wonderful, Snippy! But is that all?  Those changes won't confuse the customer long enough;  soon they will stop subscribing to our ignorant help hot lines.

Ms. Snippy (bubbling over): Oh, we've done much more.  Starting with, reducing backwards-compatibility with our own earlier software, and popular programs like Lotus 1-2-3 and Adobe Acrobat; so now it will cost those companies more, to sync with our 'new' software.  And less of their own products, will be read by OUR software, just the same!

Mr. Fleece (eyes wide):  aha, so we can blame them for lack of compatibility, and make more money thereby.  Well done, Snippy!

Ms. Snippy (ecstatic):  Well, here's the best part: we create NEW JOBS!  For now ALL the older material must be retyped or reformatted within our own products, thousands of hours of NEW WORK spent on old material which used to be converted in an instant!  That extra work, is good for America!

Mr. Fleece (with the Arm-and-Hammer look):  yes, teaches the customer a lesson that he shouldn't go anywhere but to us!  for all his software needs.

Ms. Nudger (sheepishly):  Um, excuse me.  We've also made our own earlier products incompatible with the 'new' version.  So how do we blame the other software companies, when in fact we also are incompatible with our own products?

Mr. Fleece:  Can't you recognize 'progress'?  It's the policy here to force people to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, never ending, never matching, never fitting the past -- just like DETROIT proudly does with American cars!  You're UNAMERICAN, Nudger; and you're FIRED!

===========

The above fictional conversation is not wholly fictional.  Eleven years ago, my one and only pay-for-help hour spent with a Microsoft employee basically resulted in him admitting Fleece's last lines.  In the name of progress.  I kid you not.  The rest of the fictional conversation is easily deduced by the actual history of MS products.  So too, here with Word 2003, when the elimination of backwards-compatibility, really begins.  Later versions of Office are even worse.  I've tried and rejected them.  But after reading reviews of how Word 2003 allegedly fixed the bugs with respect to right-to-left text (i.e., Hebrew), I wanted to try this.  Yeah, what a mistake!  Two copies I bought, both of them nearly useless!

Why?  Um, if you can't even retrieve your own previous files in the 'upgrade' version, then why upgrade?  Hmmmm?

For every 'upgrade' of Office becomes more and more dysfunctional.  I bought Word 2003 due to the many bugs in Word 2000-2002, but guess what?  Word 2003 TOOK AWAY what was good in those older programs, and substituted even more bugs and dysfunctionality.  That 'progress' continues from Word 2003, onward.  OFFICE and hence Word 2010 is so incompatible, after downloading the trial version in only two hours I was so frustrated, I uninstalled it. With difficulty.

Here's the scam: the 'upgrades' are like the opening dialogue, above.  The 'upgrades' complicate procedures which were simple in earlier versions, especially in Word and Excel, prior to version 2003.  For example, you used to just click on Help, and you actually got a chm file OF Help.  Not now.  Now, the DEFAULT in Word takes you ONLINE.  Takes two hours to figure out how to change that default, so you can get the old help file you're used to.  So too, the ? in a dialogue box USED to function simply: you clicked on the ?, then moved your mouse to the section on the dialogue box you wanted to understand, and got a semi-coherent explanation of that section's function.  Not now.  Now, another dialogue box opens with a lot more text, and you must SCROLL SCROLL SCROLL to find the item you could have gotten in 2 seconds, under the old method.  With no more coherence, of course.  Often, even less.  Help like this:  if the dialogue box says 'make operation operational', of course you have no idea what 'operation' is in view.  So in the old days, you clicked on ? and you got a tool tip which said, 'this function makes the operation, operational'.  That of course elucidated nothing, but at least it was fast.  Now, in Word 2003, you get the same message, but it took you three or four minutes to even FIND the same line of text as in the dialogue box, within the new and de-proved help file.  That is, after you spent two hours figuring out how to turn off the default ONLINE help which of course never helped you, either.

It's not by accident that most law firms still offer backwards-compatible documents for Word97-2003.  They have to.  Legal and accounting stuff has to be kept for YEARS.  Notice the range of the offering.  2003 and prior.  Word 2003, however, is far less desirable than prior versions: its clipboard is worse, its buttons are harder to customize and actually they removed some useful button customizations like Reveal Formatting;  the PERMISSION annoyance (covered below) means you might have to go through all your old documents and establish permissions, even on your own computer (problem on XP Pro, not Home).  And frankly, I don't see any functions which are improved, versus Word 2002.  Only new annoyances.

The usual company retort to complaints like mine, is to deem the customer ignorant of computers, puh!  Balderdash.  I've been working with computers since Trash-80.  I still have my old 286's, and they still work.  Admirably.  So it's not like I'm a computer neophyte, and my business depends on word processing and spreadsheets.  To date, nothing beats Multimate II (a DOS product) for merges, and DOS (not Windows) Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x, for calculations.  All Excel has to offer, is formatting the final product.

To wit:  oh, now in Excel 2003, you can't retrieve Lotus 1-2-3 wk1 files, but get a 'restricted policy' notice.  By the way, this very 'policy' is itself buggy.  If I use XP Home, I don't get the problem.  It only occurs with XP Pro.  See?  MS products don't work with each other.  That lone $90 hour I spent paying for MS help years ago, resulted in this gem of explanation:  each programmer only gets certain subroutines to write.  The programmers are isolated, and don't get to see how the product fits together.  So OF COURSE there will be bugs.  Design requires a wholistic approach, which at MS, is anathema.  Okay, then: their products will waste billions of dollars in customer time trying to work around the bugs.  Not to mention, eventually MS will tank due to such a stupid policy.  But I digress...

Back to the problem: you can't open your own files when you are the administrator?  And you're not told how to get permission?  Oh, wait: you can ONLY get permission if you use Microsoft's ONLINE PASSPORT SERVICE?  Access to your own computer not online, depends on you establishing credentials online? Oh but yes!  You download a silly 'rights management' program which you can't even install, unless you subscribe to NET passport ONLINE, which means to access your own files on your own computer to use them in Office, you have to BE online, establish your credentials, and only THEN can you open your own documents on your own computer.  What drunk thought of that?  And of course, if MS voluntarily ends the PASSPORT program, then you can't even do that convoluted and needless procedure to open your own documents on your own computer offline.

So MS won't even allow you the administrator to control your own computer, with Word 2003. So here's the scam workaround: you have to settle for XP Home, or contact them in Redmond; of course you wait for an hour on the phone, then for $90 per hour they will be happy to spend four more hours 'helping' you to solve THEIR OWN TYRANNICAL BUG.  Of course, the 'help' person at MS knows absolutely nothing about the software, so first you go through irrelevant questions like do you have a virus, in order to eat up time and cost you more money.

Forget the other junk in the Suite.  It works not at all.  The Outlook 2003 was so badly designed I just flat removed it.

Excel is totally retarded, for audit-trail accounting.  Everything about its structure is buggy and arcane.  I spent FOUR HOURS today, just trying to figure out why it wouldn't recognize a labelled number, as a LABEL.  Previous version of Excel had the opposite bug: if you typed in a number, it automatically treated it as a label, unless you put an equals or plus or minus sign in front of the number.  Sheesh.  But at least Excel 2002 and prior, would recognize the label marker and treat what followed AS a label.  (This matters: say you're doing billing like I was, and you wanted to LABEL a billing amount, to keep it out of your totals;  in Excel 2002 and prior, you can do that easily.  But NOT, in Excel 2003, and no FUNCTION formula will let you do it.  More could be said, but then I'll have apoplexy.)

By contrast, old DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x -- which IBM owns now, and won't sell -- along with its add-in (nee: Funk Software) 'Worksheet Utilities' is totally superior, especially for actuarial and other number-intensive, date-intensive, audit-trail-intensive calculations.  Runs in a DOS window in XP, and I'm told by my computer guys that I can get a DOS window in Win7, so might upgrade to Win7.  Whew.  Calculation in our modern computers is instantaneous.  DOS rocks.  So too, that version of Lotus.  Later versions don't work well with dates.  Forget the later Quattro Pro, too.

Excel's only good for formatting the final reports, and even then inanely won't let you store print STYLES without extreme effort: you do it by setting up your windows, print area, then name the whole thing as a CUSTOM VIEW.  Forget macros.

I could spend hours ranting about the flaws in Word or Office Professional, vintage 2010 backwards.  Word is totally incapable of a decent merge, for example.  The trouble you have to go to in order to make merging work in Word, means that unless you've got thousands of records, you might as well do it by hand.  And with thousands of records, count on half of them coming out wrong unless yhou spend thousands of hours designing a very precise database which is thirty times harder to manage, versus the old DOS days.  Unbelievable.  No wonder prices rise so much.  We're all spending downtime trying to get basic word processing functions, to work!

So too, forget Front Page;  it's easier to write your own html code in Word.  Business Contact Manager?  You're better off with pencil and paper!  Access?  Someone on crack designed it. The Photo thingy isn't all that bad, but its bugs abound.  Outlook 2003 is the worst.  They removed all the flexibility of earlier Outlook versions, and of course made the interface completely frustrating, to boot.  Outlook has always been way overcomplicated, but if you have a lot of stuff to juggle and you use it daily (which you must, or you'll forget how) -- it can be helpful.  Simpler is old Sidekick in DOS.  Sigh, you can't store it in the UMB, in Windows.  But it works just fine on an old 486...

So instead of reading only my ranting -- Google on a MS program name, add the word 'sucks' -- you'll find even whole discussion forums devoted to that second word.  Usually such vulgar language is inapt.  But not here.  Every swear word ever invented, belongs to Office products and to MS software in general.  It's deliberately unintuitive, confusing, buggy and mediocre, so you have to subscribe to paid help.  That's the only explanation which makes sense of the data. Same can be said for Adobe, Roxio, Symantec and Corel products.  So MS isn't the only scammer in town.

Go back to DOS software:  its products work well on these faster machines.

===============

UPSHOT:  If you are lonely and want to spend all your free time debugging MS Office gaffes, then buy Word 2003 or Office Professional 2003 et seq. If on the other hand you like me are stuck with Word and want to know the latest version which worked -- though buggy, is manageable -- get Office 2002 or 2000.  Best was Word97, but getting it to work in XP is something of a problem.  Hope you kept your Win98SE machines. :)

So now, I just uninstalled Word 2003, and go back to Word 2002.  At least they don't prohibit you from accessing your own files!  Gotta install it now, byeeee."

1,"Look, I could write a review that tries to coddle those who are having a problem with this McAfee Virus Scan program, but for me, it is like finally arriving after a sea of disappointments. (I am talking about McAfee VirusScan Plus 2008-3 User Newest Version) Make sure you remove all other antivirus programs, and firewalls first before loading this McAfee Virus application. I have never seen an antivirus program that works properly with a 2nd antivirus program loaded at the same time.
It includes a Security Center, Virus Scan, Personal Firewall, Easy Network, and Site Advisor.

First of all forgive me for writing such a long review, but there is a lot of ground to cover. For those who like the short version, with less information here it is: Norton slowed my DSL connection down by a third. I spent a day with Verizon, couldn't figure out why all of my other machines in the network were getting 756k, and this one got only 4 or 500 tops. Then I removed Norton, and bingo, instant 756k. AVG free edition is nice but takes a lot of boot up time while it updates upon every single boot up, unless you disable that feature, then it sends out your Outlook email with a message that your antivirus is out of date, and this email could be dangerous, or something like that. Zone Alarm used to be the best, now they are nearing the worst. My Windows 2000 machine went blue screen after an update, took me 2 days to figure out that was the problem, so I removed it after discovering the problem in a forum, and it solved it. Also ZA after recommending it to my friend, would not work at all in a Windows XP Media Center machine. Ask ZA and they say they no longer support it in Media Center. 50 bucks down the drain. Now it takes my XP regular edition SP2 well over 5 minutes to boot with Zone Alarm Security Suite, and I mean WELL over 5 minutes; it's ridiculous. I removed it to load this McAfee Virus Scan (MVS), and the machine immediately booted in only 2 minutes and 15 seconds to the point I was able to bring a Google page up. So I loaded this MVS and the machine booted in only 2 minutes and 45 seconds, once again to a Google page appearing. In both cases I clicked on a Google desktop icon as soon as it appeared, and then waited for the results. It clicks, goes dark blue, and waits for everything else to load, including MVS before it will allow a page to appear. So MVS took only 30 additional seconds to load, and according to Scotty the watchdog in WinPatrol, it loads about 7 .exe files. So that is fast. Now that is with a machine that is loaded up with a ton of programs.

I first loaded MVS in my home office machine, in the same network, with the same configuration, Asus A8N SLI, AMD 64 3200+, 1Gb ram. The home office machine with MVS loaded, gave me the same results but in approximately one minute before I could get a Google page up. (This is an edit, I actually timed the boot up, and not counting the time to type in my password, it booted in exactly 42 seconds) Boot up to Google in only a minute with MVS, and in 2 minutes and 45 seconds in my overloaded machine that used to take well over 5 minutes with Zone Alarm. I'm sold.

While performing a scan it did not affect the performance of the machine, either in surfing the web, or opening programs, even the intensive programs like Dreamweaver MX 2004, or Photoshop CS2.

When loading do as the quick start guide says, put in the CD, then choose the option of loading from the web. It's a 45 Meg download, but it's the latest.

Manage network feature, it recognized all of the other machines, and components with an IP address in my network. It recognized my Windows Server 2003 R2 Edition, but gave me a status message of a request to upgrade to an operating system of at least W2000 or later. I guess that is because of W2003 security, blocking scans.

Before I even acquired MVS I did not understand exactly what they meant by the 3 user allowance, and couldn't find anything on it, so I want to share that with you. Did they mean that you could load it on one machine sharing a network, and then scan individual drives across the network, the same way early ZA did, or does this mean you can put it in more than one machine for full protection at all times. Fortunately it means the latter. I loaded it in the home office machine, registering it in my name to be able to get virus updates, and created a user name and password. Then I went into the other machine, dropped in the CD, did a complete install, but when the registration page came up, I logged in instead, and it instantly completed the registration for me, reminding me of my user name and password, and congratulating me on the installation. So it is a 3 machine complete install, that is cool, or should I say way cool.

I know this isn't about MVS but I advise you to get a free copy of CCleaner from the web. (Google it.) It cleans all the junk out of your computer and you can run it quickly before entering sensitive password sites for example. It cleans out your cache, cookies, etc. in only a few seconds. When you run it for the first time, it will take several minutes to remove it all, for example a ton of web pages you have been surfing, that your machine checks first, before drawing it from the distant server. A slooooow way for your machine to have to work.

McAfee has been around for a zillion years, they have been a leader, and from the performance of this product so far, they have totally aced it. You can see all of the other antivirus and firewall programs I have tried, and this one according to boot up time, and scan speed is the best. It scanned my office machine quickly, although I did not time it accurately. It scanned several gigs of data in what seemed like 10 minutes. My other machine with 230 Gigs of data takes about 5 hours with Zone Alarm, because I am using their older 7.0 version, it took 3 times that long with their newer version that works with Vista and XP. I am using it on an XP machine. Once again, had to get rid of the update, and go back to an earlier version.

Look I can't speak for everyone, or everyone's machine, but all I know is I am totally impressed with this McAfee product, and hope and pray they don't go down the tubes like Norton, and Zone Alarm did. (I have not used any recent Norton products, but Norton was the best when Peter Norton was there solving the DOS problems, almost like a miracle man, then from about 10 years ago, everything of theirs I tried was junk.) Sorry for the pointed remarks, but sometimes you find a product, after spending years in frustration, or at least you find something that works, then it goes bad, and finally, finally, something that really works great like this MVS. For me, my hat is off to McAfee. 150 Stars and counting. Highly recommended to say the least.
PS: I noticed another reviewer was having problems logging onto online acounts, so I put it to the test, logged into my bank account, which is a 3 step process, and also my online server, and did not have any problems. If I have any, or notice anything after using this product more, I will come back and edit the review. All of the essentials place this one at the top for now."

1,"I use this product in my work, but it takes some getting used to after using Word 2002 for many years. Lots of improvements."

1,"....Core Duo with 2GB of ram I can run Windows Vista. I am having to allocate 1 GB of ram to get reasonable performance. I do not dedicate both ""cores"" to VM Fusion, but I will caution you that performance on the Mac side will be sluggish on a machine like this while running VMWare.

But, let's think about this. I have a machine that was the cheapest mac sold about 4 years ago. I installed and set up Windows Vista without a single hitch. Everything works out of the box. Consider the complaints you hear about Vista (fair or not). I am running it fine, no problems at all.

The applications I am running are fairly simple. No Solidworks or other 3D software. No games. Just IE, Microsoft office, Camtasia and a few other things. It fills in the gaps for things I need to test out, not owning a ""real PC"".

Should you get this? Do you need to run windows apps with no fuss, and decent performance? Don't want to deal with setting up boot camp, and want both your Mac and ""PC"" available at the same time? Would like like to share folders between machines, and generally not have to mess around with a real PC? How about this -- be able to run pre-made computer OS images so that you can try out stuff like Ubuntu or Drupal without have to install anything? I wanted to test OLPC's Sugar interface, so I found a prebuilt image for VMWare and just ran it -- bingo -- I have a OLCP test machine for web content.

This is well worth owning if you answered yes to any of the questions above."

1,"I bought 2015 Premier to continue use of One Step Update functionality (my 2012 Premier One Step would become non-functional after April 2015),  2015 Premier installation was smooth without problems, it converted my QP2012 Portfolio data sets to QP2015 format (after first auto-saving my existing QP2012 data sets in a separate folder). The only somewhat annoying step was that I had to ""register"" with a Quicken User Name and password, etc. individually when converting each QP2012 portfolio to QP2015 format - that is, it doesn't provide a global ""registration"" applicable to all portfolios. All portfolios were converted correctly and all existing username+password settings for each One Step Update account were preserved.

I don't recall seeing in QP2012, but Q2015 does have useful reports for investment asset allocations.  It also provides an investment ""X-Ray"" feature to capture Morningstar info for investment (however, I haven't used that feature so I can't comment on it further).

Overall, QP2015 (like QP2012 before it, from my experience) is a terrific product.  Easy to use, easy to update transaction data (either manually or via One Step (once you've setup access with your financial institutions), and provides useful pre-configured (and customizable) investment & tax reports.  I highly recommend this product."

1,"I've been using Quicken since the late 80s or early 90s. I LOVE this software. In this version you can attach PDF or JPG files to transactions, so I scan all my receipts and attach them to my transactions. When ever I need to find a receipt to return something, I have it in an instant. It's really easy to use software, no more difficult than entering transactions into your check book registry, but these you can search with any word. I can print out reports of payments made to my insurance or who ever to show that payments were made when there is a dispute. I download all my credit card transactions right into Quicken, all my banking transactions get downloaded right into the proper registry. I can't even imagine not having Quicken or anything being easier or more complete to use."

0,"For the price, Media Expressions is a relatively decent choice for someone who wants do use something kind of like Photoshop, but doesn't want to shell out the big bucks. Other than that, there's really not a whole lot here. And I don't know about you, but if you've used the YouTube downloader that this software comes with, I would appreciate some words of advice on how to not have it error out as often as it does. It's a little embarrassing. But I really don't know if that's my computer or is really a problem with the software.

PROS:

-Inexpensive
-Effective for beginners

CONS:

-Poor interface
-Video Editing is almost non-existent

If you're really new to photo/video editing and improvement, you may very well like Media Expressions. If you're more advanced, or even intermediate, this is really not for you."

0.5,"This is my first year filling out taxes with Turbo Tax. I choose this option because I tend to put it off till the last second the manual way. It took about 2 hours (with interuptions and fumbling through paper work) for me to fill out both FED and STATE taxes, and for the most part it was relatively stress free.

I did end up downloading an out of state tax form by mistake (costing me 36 dollars). Hopefully next year's program will be smart enough to download the correct state forms automatically after analyzing the federal information. However, after a frustrating half hour trying to find Turbo Tax's phone number ( 1.800.4INTUIT), I called and recieved a refund (without a hassle).

I still ended up paying more by e-filing my state and federal taxes (which cost 17 dollars each). I think it is a bit deceptive that they promote the e-file feature without mentioning the extra charge.

I will give it another shot next year."

-0.5,"I've used Office for years on PCs, but this was my first time to use  Office 2008 for Mac. I have an Intel-based iMac and this software product is slow. Compared with Apple's iWork suite of office-like programs, Office is simply snail-like. Although Office 2008 has a few more features than iWork it's not as tightly integrated among applications. Office still has the look and feel of a loose collection of programs acquired over the years by Microsoft and  called a ""system."" I much prefer the cheaper and more tightly integrated iWork over Office 2008 and wish I had saved my money and bought only iWork."

1,"Moving to Windows 8, even 8.1, was the last thing I wanted to do. If forced to do it, I was convinced it would not be for a long time. I was very happy with Windows 7, as I was XP Pro in former years. My plan was to upgrade from Win 7 Home Premium to Ultimate and, with the added features and security, stay there as long as possible. But, actually I found that to get there was more getting improbable than I imagined, or just unfeasible. I had waited too long to do those Win 7 upgrades. Microsoft was no longer offering them. There were no bargains left. With what looked like bargains, I was seeing too many people getting burned with counterfeit copies of software. The software available that was legit, priced itself out of reach (yes, the unfeasible part).

Then, I saw this option. With some promotional credits I could use, and the list price of this upgrade, the cost would be insignificant. Most of the reviews I read here helped me to overcome the last vestiges of the stigma I saw attached to Windows 8. The free upgrade to 8.1 was helpful because that's where I wanted to go and make my computers have the look and feel of Win 7. It worked!

It was quick, pretty straight-forward, and included the entire migration of programs, features, and files from Windows 7 to Windows 8.

The initial download took less than 20 minutes, building an ISO file (which I didn't use) another 10, and the shortcut (mentioned below in the reviews) of first downloading and installing only the ""kb2871389"" update, permitted me to move right to the 8.1 upgrade. Once there, the 8.1 upgrade and the other updates took some time. I finally downloaded ""Classic Shell,"" which was the last step necessary to give the look and feel of Windows 7.

I highly recommend this. I believe that this will give lasting life to my desktops. This is a stable operating system. You won't notice much of a difference at all. And, with this option, you cannot beat the price!"

0,"Pro:  The product is pretty good although you still need to know what you are doing in any kind of complex situation.  I've tried other tax prep products and this is the best, albeit imperfect.
I give it 3 stars because of the huge cost to do state e-file.  This is really deceptive price advertising -- they say it comes Federal + State, but if you actually want to FILE your taxes then it's another $25.
The other terrible thing is if you pay your taxes electronically.  You GET NO RECEIPT OR PAYMENT CONFIRMATION.  The instructions say to check your credit card bill next month to verify that payment was made!  And the service fee charged is the highest of all possible online tax payment choices.  OK, you've got me as a captive customer, it's much more convenient to pay as part of the finalization of the return, but if you're going to charge me the highest fee in the market, don't you think you could give me the convenience of payment confirmation details?"

0,"I prepared returns for C corp, S corp and LLC. The S corp could not be e-filed because of bugs in the program but no trouble with the C and LLC.

If one accepts that e-file won't work (or else won't work well) for S corp, then the disappointment won't be as great. Here's a list of most of the bugginess I experienced with the S:
* Would not provide a form that I needed, one of the basic forms.
* Gave me an error for my zip code, saying it's not in my state, although it is.
* One of the forms was mislabeled, a weird thing to happen and a software problem.

But I e-filed the C and LLC, and I paper filed the S. So one can make the program work.

Also, I was able to upload my last year's tax filings which I had saved on my hard drive and were from the same H&R Block tax software. There was no trouble whatsoever with that, and I was actually most worried about that.

All in all, I would buy this tax software again and probably will next year. I dislike that I can't use it on another operating system other than Windows, but then again it's not highly priced when one has several returns to prepare.

It's not the easiest tax software to use, giving warnings that are sometimes unhelpful and cannot be ""fixed."" But it's not that difficult either except of course that I could not e-file the S due to some software bugs. I would not recommend it to a true friend nor would I try to dissuade anybody from using it at their own risk as we do whenever we use inexpensive tax software that's targeted to nonprofessionals."

It keeps my computer clean and running smooth. Recommended."

1,"I've wanted Corel Draw Graphics Suite for several years but my budget always got in the way! I purchased Corel Draw Essentials, older versions of Corel Draw, and a home and student version. None of these satisfied me! What has satisfied me is Corel Draw Graphics Suite X6. It has all the features I want. easy to navigate, and has a 300+ hard cover guidebook! Since I am familiar with earlier versions of CorelDraw, I haven't had occasion to use the manual (yet)... but what I did discover about the manual is that offers a lot of ideas for the tools that are part of CorelDraw and I probably would overlook the possibilities. This is a first-class graphics suite in every way and inclues not only CorelDraw X6 but also Photo-Paint, Power-Trace, Website Creator, Corel Capture, and more. I like Photo-Paint, a professional photo editing application. If someone asked me if this is worth $500, I'd certainly say, ""Yes!"". Believe me, you'll get your money's worth with this edtion of CorelDraw. Additionally, there are 1,000 professional Open Type fonts, thousands of photos, images, and templates. There's also a two-hour training video to supplement the manual! CorelDraw Graphics Suite X6 functions as smooth as silk! Highly recommended."

1,"Norton has almost always been my favorite security program. I began using it in 1990 when it was Norton Commander - a menu system for DOS -  and stuck with it through almost all its incarnations. At some point, maybe seven or eight years ago, it became bloated and I began using free products, which worked fine without slowing the computer to a crawl - but I missed the full scans and features in Norton that I always found so trustworthy.

Six years ago, I switched to a Mac and didn't go back to Norton. I used nothing for a while since Macs are less likely to be hacked, but that made me very nervous. I installed the free version of Avast and used it until a Mac-savvy friend who was trying to speed my old Mac back up told me I really needed Norton for Mac. (Indeed there was a disk-filling virus in that machine that only Norton was able to catch - Avast was unaware of it.) He told me to run full scans regularly - not just the quickies - and I did that, too.)

When I got a new Mac earlier this year, my Norton was expiring so I went back to Avast for a while. It's good - it caught a virus, in fact, and does a lot of what Norton does - but it slows the computer considerably.  Now I have Norton in my new Mac and things are running very smoothly. The days of bloat are gone. Norton runs fast and clean and even the in-depth scans don't take too long - or slow the machine perceptibly.

If you need to protect more than one device, get a version that covers multiple devices - it will be a lot cheaper. If, like me, you only protect one computer, this one is perfect."

1,"My husband love to shoot video then he turns to me hoping for me to make ""magic"" with it.  For years I've used Adobe Premiere Elements.  However It always seemed more trouble than it was worth (however I really loved all the features but probably only used a small percentage of them).  With this product I was impressed from the start.  I love the fact that I can ""float"" the main video window off to a second screen leaving more editing space.

The tabs and menus are easy to navigate.  I also like that for editing there is a lower quality ""copy"" that does not effect the quality for the final product but does not bog down the editing process with large files.

So far impressed
- easy to navigate
- program runs smoothly with not lots of ""thinking"" time (ie the program does not run slow even when working with high quality video)"

0.5,"""WinDVD 9"" really is a fantastic, feature rich DVD and video playback software package, once you get it installed on a good computer. Here are my observations:

First the good -
* Picture clarity is simply amazing! The ""upscaling"" on standard DVDs shocked me at how much better the picture looked

* Fantastic features for laptop users, like ""TimeStretch"", allow for optimal performance

* Using the controls are easy with the intuitive user interface

Now the bad -
* Software will install on a system that does not meet the minimum requirements (costing a ""*"" on my rating). This cost me a good bit of time trying to figure out why a DVD would not play back on my two year old laptop (got an ""Overlay"" error).

* Software will report errors from other programs while installing if the wrong versions are not present. This was explained in a package insert and did not impact the actual installation.

Once the software was installed on my new laptop, I was more than pleased with this package and am quite impressed with the performance. Recommended for newer PCs."

0,"Over all, it does a good job to help with the taxes as well as filling them. Over not much has changed in this style or procedure which is nice since taxes are hard enough on their own.

1,"Pinnacle Studio 19 Plus is  good mid-level video editing software. Its price point and functionality are targeted towards the beginner-intermediate editor, and it works reliably, has powerful editing capabilities, and import/export functionality. I run it on a Windows 10 computer (about 1.5 years old) and haven't had an issues with it. This is a solid software choice if you're looking for editing software for personal or family videos, or for basic work/technical film editing.

The learning curve is reasonable and in 1-2 hours, you can do basic editing and video composition. The more sophisticated inputs and channels will take a little longer to learn - but still approachable. The interface of the program isn't too cluttered, and common tools have shortcuts.

YouTube has been invaluable for finding tutorials on how to do different things, and I've relied on it a lot."

1,"I have been a huge fan of Pinnacle Studio products for years.

This release is no dissapointment.

I don't get every release, so much had changed since my last copy. It has greatly improved the process of importing video and photos from your digital device of choice. Combined with video capture devices such as a Dazzle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dazzle-Digital-Video-Creator-DVC-90-Video-Capture-Device-and-Movie-Maker/dp/B00028CAL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dazzle Digital Video Creator DVC-90 Video Capture Device and Movie Maker</a>&nbsp;you can even convert all of your old VHS tapes into electronic media files...which I have done.

The ability to import projects from your iPad's Avid Studio is a huge plus as well. You can even creat custom-fit soundtracks. But probably the best improvement is the way in which you can instantly share your videos via Facebook or YouTube rather than just making a DVD and dropping it in the mailbox...but you can still make DVD's as well.

This is not a high end video editing suite, but for the masses, the ""you and me"" types, Pinnacle has always delivered both form and function."

0.5,"When deciding on an operating system (OS), several factors come into play. Will this OS be intalled onto a laptop or desktop? Is it networked? Will I use this for ""business type applications"" or ""personal type applications""? Do I need strong multimedia capabilities?
Windows 2000 Professional is an extremely stable OS. After running it for almost two weeks non-stop, I never had a single problem. Crashes and the infamous ""blue screen of death"" became obsolete things of the past (unless you're using ME). As long as I did what the OS told me, for example not installing unsigned drivers, the OS behaved the way I wanted it to.
Windows 2000 is also an excellent machine for networking, which is simplified by helpful wizards that will guide even a novice through. Because it is so simple to accomplish, this is a favorite OS for laptop users and businesses.
Windows 2000 lacks multimedia capabilities found in Windows ME. Some very simplistic multimedia functions are lost in this OS... If you are finding a gaming system, this is NOT it. Another downfall is that many of the drivers are special for 2000, because it lacks the DOS background in ME. This is very similar to XP. Do not worry about this problem however, because almost all equipment will have 2000 drivers.
Finally, Windows 2000 looks a lot like ME, making it convenient for an individual who is used to the 9x/ME environment to convert over to the 2000 environment, without crossing over the problems of ME.
This is a great OS, however, for the individual desiring the stability and power of this NT based system, as well as the multimedia components of 9x/ME, Windows XP Professional is the way to go..."

1,"The free OpenOffice suite has reached amazing levels of quality and feature sets. It may not offer all the bells and whistles you can find in the Microsoft products, but it's solid, reliable software with excellent compatibility with the MS Office standard. You will not have any problems exchanging most Word or Excel documents, and it's more than most students will ever need.
In a business environment, exchanging documents that are heavily formatted and contain graphics is not 100% painless though. If you must collaborate with Microsoft Office users on this type of document, make sure you run a few tests before switching.
Still, this is superb, feature-laden, reliable software that offers more than most people need at an unbeatable price -- and there's no catch. No ad banners, no subscription, no nagging dialogs... Everyone should install this suite."

1,"I was skeptical that an entry-level product would really allow me to create animations, but Anime Studio delivers the goods. It's a powerful product, with a clean upgrade path to it's big brother. But it will be a very long time before I grow out of this one.

Here are my favorite features:

Motion Tracking: you can open a motion video (a camcorder video, for example), mark an object in the video, and Anime Studio will track that object through multiple frames. You can then use this marker to attach one of your animations. Imagine the possibilities: Animated characters can dance with your children on video-all you have to do is animate the character, then attach the animated character to your child in the video. Cool!

Lip Syncing: You can sync a characters lip movements to audio easily. This is pretty hard to do manually. Anime Studio has a command to take care of it. So the character dancing with your child can sing too!

Lots of Import options, including Photoshop. Anime Studio preserves Photoshop layers, which saves lots of time if you use Photoshop.

Finally, keep in mind that animations are not necessarily cartoons. Anytime you need a picture or text to move in a complex way on top of or below other pictures, you are doing animation. So there are business applications too (think product instructional videos with animations of parts interacting with other parts, with hatches opening and latches latching...you get the idea).

OK, now for my input device recommendation: Anime Studio has good drawing tools. Lots of animation work requires precise placement of points, drawing of paths, etc. You really want to use a tablet. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WACOM-CTE450K-Black-Bamboo-Fun-Tablet-with-Pen-Mouse-Graphics-Software-NEW/dp/B002QJASB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WACOM CTE450K Black Bamboo Fun Tablet with Pen, Mouse & Graphics Software (NEW)</a>&nbsp;is a perfect match for Anime Studio. It comes with both a mouse and pen, plus some great software.  You can use Anime Studio with a mouse, but a pen tablet makes life easier and more fun.

Highly recommended, especially given the low price."

1,"The thing I like the most about the AVG Anti-Virus and Spyware software is that it runs in the background without bothering me and most of the time I don't even know it's there.  I've used an earlier version of this software for just over a year, so when I saw this package being offered I ordered it for my husband's new PC which is running Windows 7.  I like not having all the advertising pop-ups that I've had to deal with on other anti-virus programs and I also like that it doesn't seem to affect the speed of my computer when booting like some other titles have done in the past.  I also like the fact that it installs very easily, just a few clicks of the mouse and you're on your way.  What is under the hood may be complex, but from where I sit it's very easy to use and I've never had any problems with a virus.

This product comes with technical support although I've never had any reason to use it.  It's pretty simple and straightforward.  Another thing I like is it scans your downloads of music, files, and applications and does it in the background without slowing you down and it's behind the scenes where you don't even realize it's happening.  You also get free upgrades automatically and scans automatically on a schedule that you can decide.  You can also do a scan whenever you want by simply opening the AVG control center.  There's a thing called LinkScanner SurfShield which ensures every website you visit is safe and you get a message if there's a question so you can avoid the site or override the software and take your chances.

All in all, it's a great security program.  Fast, easy to use, doesn't bother you with a bunch of ads for add-on products and you are hardly aware that it's there working for you.  Best of all, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg!"

1,"""Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus"", from Corel Corp., downloaded to my 64bit PC without incident. The program started up quickly and has an intuitive, and familiar, appearance; hovering over most button choices causes an explanatory pop-up. The ""Help"" menu  provides a downloadable 'User Manual' and 'Sample Movie' in addition to links for updates, forums, and support. For the purpose of this review I emailed for support and was surprised at the very quick, and helpful, response.

Although very familiar with a variety of sophisticated photography programs I'm a novice at video creation and 'Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus' is the only program I've had the opportunity to try. I found the 'User Manual' explicit, easy to read and understand, and enormously helpful. There's also an included 45 day access pass to Pinnacle's 'Studio Backlot' where you'll find a host of tutorials. And there are also tutorials available on 'YouTube'.

I've found this program easy to use as it employs familiar actions like drag and drop, but, it also has a learning curve that requires a bit of time and practice to acquire proficiency. After using Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus, off and on, for a few weeks I'm no where near the professional I'd like to be. However, I am confident I'll get there."

We learned the program together and I was very impressed with the ease of use and power of this software. We installed this on a fairly powerful laptop running Windows Vista and have no issues with speed or stability. Here are my observations:

+ Great Tutorials; take the time to read the directions and watch the videos - greatly shortens the learning curve
+ Easy to Interface; tools are laid out intuitively and are easy to access
+ Good Tablet Support; while not needed to get full use, we have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bamboo-Small-Pen-Tablet-with-Pen-Only/dp/B000V9T2JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bamboo (Small) Pen Tablet with Pen Only</a>, and it works great with this program

-1,"I bought the 7.0 version in the hopes of sharing a 500gb RAID drive between my XP and Mac systems. After installing Paragon, the drive mounted fine and seemed to be operational. I had a FCP project with about 40gb of files on the drive.

Before getting to work I decided to organize things a little, moving a folder with 20gb of QT movies into a different folder. Mistake. I got a 'this operation could not be completed because the files could not be found' error. The folder with the 20gb of movies then disappeared. Gone.

Luckily, I have this backed up, unfortunately I'm working remotely which means I now have to have someone overnight me the 20gbs worth of files that have ceased to exist.

While this product might work fine for a drive you're using to transfer files, where you can afford to have it occasionally spontaneously delete files, I have zero faith in it for day to day use. Use at your own risk."

0.5,"This is simply the basic Norton Internet Security software with a web interface that is simple to use for non-IT people who need to administer security software on multiple devices.  It also allows for additional devices to be added during the subscription period at a prorated cost.

Like all anti-malware software, it saps resources and slows everything down, but at least it is not true malware disguised as anti-malware.

What is very odd is that there are two different products on the Amazon page with a significantly different cost.  The less expensive version is a download.  The more expensive version is also a download.  The difference is that the more expensive version comes with the activation code on a card in a box that is shipped to the consumer and it is available outside of the U.S."

1,"This Internet Security has worked great!  It was very easy to install.  At times, other anti-virus programs have been difficult to use because they make you uninstall the previous security service before you can use their program.  With this Titanium product, it uninstalled the old program itself once I gave it permission.  That was very convenient and quick.  I have also been very impressed with the monthly reports that are given to me.  I don't have to be reminded to go to the program to see what's going on, a small window pops up and allows me to stay abreast of any threats or security concerns that were presented within the past month.  Again, I have been very happy with this product."

1,"If you have 2009 installed already (which I have) then all this software needs to do is update to 2010 which is a simple process.  I have it installed on a Vista computer and an Atom Netbook with Windows XP and it functions perfectly on both.

An overview of MapPoint is that it is a must for the serious / business users; it has all the features of Streets and Trips plus powerful data mapping, information analysis, and communication tools.

It is very powerful.  You can basically search by street to any location in the USA and Canada plus it also has street level coverage of Mexico.

It is easy to use.  You can type in a street or just click on the map.  You can put in start and end locations and MapPoint will map it all out for you so you can streamline those travel plans.

If you want to see detailed data information on different areas such as age, population, etc. then this program has it.  This is great for business users so you can target certain products to certain areas.  You can also use the maps etc. in your Microsoft Office applications (such as Word, Excel etc.) to create your own specialized documents.

Once you get rolling then you can plug the GPS receiver in your car into your computer and then run MapPoint in the full screen navigation mode to follow that route you already planned earlier.  It even has voice direction.

I really enjoy using this software, it has all the features of a good navigation program plus it is a powerful mapping and information tool.  The functionality is near perfect which is as you would expect from Microsoft.

The 2010 version is a good update and enhances the program to give it even more features and make it even more user friendly."

0.5,"Windows XP really is the best windows operating system to date.  It is not perfect by any means, but it works the way it's supposed to almost all the time.  If you're thinking about using this upgrade version, let me warn you of two things:  (1) You need to check all of your software to see if it's compatible with XP (there is a checking-program on this disc, but you can also download it from Microsoft's website to see which software you have is not compatible).  Even after I checked compatibility, some programs I had were non-functioning after the upgrade and some I had to install again.  (2) Download the most recent drivers for all your hardware to avoid problems.  I didn't do this and when I upgraded, I lost my sound card drivers because they weren't compatible with XP and the XP disc didn't have the new drivers I needed to make my sound card work, so I had to find my sound card manufacturer's website and download an XP compatible driver.
You are really better off waiting until you buy a new computer to get XP.  But, if you just can't wait and want to do this upgrade, make sure you do your homework to avoid some headaches during and after installation.  It almost sounds like I'm slamming this upgrade release, I'm not - I absolutely love Windows XP - but the upgrade version does require some extra effort on your part, especially if your computer is older than a year or more."

-1,"I haven't used AVPs for years, mainly because I don't need them (I know what to not click on) and they slow my system to a crawl.  This is ridiculous.  In those 3-5 years I have not used one of these programs, someone could have noticed this HUGE design flaw and fixed it.  My system still slows to nearly a complete stop.  And killing it in Task Manager doesn't help, either.  I was afraid that even after uninstalling it I was still going to feel the pain of the AVP, so I actually went back to do a system restore to prior the McAfee installation.  System runs smooth as silk, now, and I still don't have to worry about viruses.  Instead, invest in a good router, and don't click on any pop ups, people!"

1,"I've taught video editing since the days of U-Matic tape and Betamax. When computer based video editing took over with Adobe Premiere, Avid, Final Cut Pro, etc. I made that jump as well. So called ""home"" editors have been around for 15-years or more, but the results and the grief necessary to get there left a-lot to be desired. I found Corel VideoStudio X8 easy to install, easy to use and full featured.

This suite is well designed and packed with usable content for sample video, music, titles, etc. If you're looking for a video editor for home videos and family memories, you really can't go wrong with this software. The timeline based editing is easy to get the hang of and adding other content and effects is as easy as drag and drop.

The software has a long list of compatible file types for importing and will format your finished video for mastering to disk (Blu-ray costs extra) or for uploading to social media, in fact the suite has a share function that makes uploading to social media a snap.

Video Studio Ultimate X8 allows up to 21 video tracks and four audio tracks (the audio ducking feature will automatically lower the level of background tracks when narration is added). It includes chroma key, multi-trim video and single clip trim.

I really could spend a week listing Facebook features and add-ones, but suffice it to say this editing software has everything for the serious home film maker and then some. For under a hundred dollars, you really can't go wrong."

-1,"Most have pointed out the flaws already, I will simply state that every device I used this operating with except my MacBook was dead within a few weeks/months due to bad drivers and terrible instability.  Better than windows 8 or 10 but sucks compared to Xp, 7 or OSX."

1,"This is a feature rich update of the Office:Mac program. The user interface is elegant, and very Mac-friendly.
Initially I had some difficulties with the program - first, it would take a very long time (upwards of 20 minutes!) to launch, and the program had real problems with Font menus. A few simple tweaks to Word, and to my font management software solved these issues. Now all my Office:Mac 2008 applications open swiftly and work smoothly.
A problem I had with the 2004 version of Word in particular was that there was a slight lag between keystroke and monitor update, so my typing was always a few words ahead of what was visible on my screen. With the '08 version, this has gone away.
If there is a flaw in the program, it would actually have to be that the new Mac-like interface has changed where tools and features are located, so I find myself having to learn my way around the program all over again. I hate to say it but I miss the old menu and toolbar structure.
Otherwise, the program works beautifully.
I'd update the star rating here to 4 1/2 if I could - can't do that when editing reviews, sorry."

0,"I've been using Quickbooks for years on a PC, and have been very happy with it, and found it to have more features than my small business actually needs.  Having switched to Macs in the last year, and cursing everytime I had to port something over from Windows to Mac, I was actually quite surprised at how easy it was to transfer my PC QB data into this new Mac version.  From there, though, I find the program lagging behind its PC counterpart.  It feels more like a ""lite"" version that a full-blown version of the QB I've come to know and love.

I haven't had problems with it crashing as have others here, but I do take issue with the fact that some program functions (most notably reconciling your bank statement) to be frustratingly slow.  I've noticed that Intuit folks have posted comments here in response to some reviews, and have mentioned that the reconciling issue is a ""known bug"" they are working on.  Ok. That's not unusual for companies to rush a title to market before it's completely bug-free (ala Microsoft), but I was expecting the Mac interface to be as elegant as other programs that I've seen ported to Mac from Windows.

All that to say, this Mac version isn't terrible, it's just not great.  I was hoping for the robust Windows experience, and them some, in this Mac version, but I'm left feeling that the Mac version won't really come into its own until a couple of more upgrades down the line.

The QB approach to accounting, regardless of format, is still the best in my book, and believe me, I've tried them all.  While I haven't used the previous Mac version, so have nothing to compare with, I wasn't blown away by this version compared to the PC version.

If you're currently using an existing Mac version, I would wait until this new version matures a bit before you upgrade."

My main issue with quicken is that the product is great until you get to the end of life which is usually 2 to 3 yrs and then most of the functionality of it becomes useless, which in fact, forces you to upgrade.

Quicken 2013 seems to be very buggy as well and has had 10 updates since its initial release.  One I found right away was trying to convert a graph to a pdf file to save, that is buggy at best and doesnt appear to work properly.  As long as this program has been around you would think that the bugs have been worked out by now.

1,"Antivirus is an important component of any operating system and its criticalness continues to grow in importance as more and more individuals find ways to infect computers, deliver spam, and otherwise do harm to the computers of others. I have used many antivirus software products and one that I continue to return to is McAfee. This latest version, McAfee Antivirus 2012 for 3 Users, is as good as ever, and I feel very confident that it will protect my information from harm.

McAfee Antivirus 2012 allows for loading on up to three different pc's for a single price and this makes it very useful for those who have pc's scattered around the house and do not want to invest in a separate antivirus purchase for each. Loading is easy and I like that McAfee Antivirus 2012 operates in the background, keeping your computer safe and without slowing down your processes. If you load a CD or anything else, it automatically scans and lets you know the coast is clear and when you schedule a nightly scan, it will tell you later if the scan didn't complete. These protections give me a safe, secure feeling and I can go about my day using my pc without worry.

McAfee Antivirus 2012 is great for fighting internet battles against viruses, spyware, and the like. If I had to find one small fault, it would be with the limitation with the three installations. If you don't install on three computers, you cannot install the remaining ones and expect it to last a full year. The countdown begins with the first install. So, if I install one on May 1, another on June 1, and a third pc on July 1, all three will reach their expiration on May 1. This is a small annoyance, but it really doesn't matter too much for me because I tend to load the antivirus on all three pc's at once anyway.

Virus protection is very important and McAfee Antivirus 2012 is one of the better products available for this purpose. It is much more intuitive than other antivirus products- so much so that a grade school age child could figure it out. It works the way an antivirus product should without slowing down your computer or causing any problems and it earns an enthusiastic recommendation."
