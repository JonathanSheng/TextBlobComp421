Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011 wasn't compatible with my version of MAC.  If I knew that from the start I wouldn't have gotten it.  I am getting a new computer soon and I will try again.  But from the looks of it I'm sure it will be fun.  I can't wait to try it out again.,",neg"

"One of the problems I had with switching from Windows XP to Windows 7 is that many of my older Microsoft products that I bought originally years ago (and then updated numerous times) didn't work on Windows 7.  If I needed them, I had to use the XP emmulation mode.

So when this version of Microsoft Streets and Trips came up, I happily tried it. As a visual learner, look at a map instead of one small section of a map is the difference between knowing where I am going and being robitically told to drive, here, then turn here, and drive here.

Not only does this include all of the simple stuff that previous program did so well (maps, route - and the measuring tool for routes) but the program now has integration for GPS units.  And you can send maps to your phone once the trip is planned.

You are asking: ""if I have a GPS unit, or a smart phone, why would I need this?""

Two scenarios: First, this is a good planning tool.  GPS Units and smartphones are designed for travel on the fly.  This is a tool that you can use to get organized with instead of simply trying touch pad in a route while the engine is running.  SECONDLY, if you plan on an irrgular route (you need stop in various places that aren't on a Point A and Point B GPS trip, this lets you figure it out before you start out. Google maps will help you one leg at a time, this helps on each step in an overall trip.

I love this program.  Its simple, it works, and they have done a great job of getting it to work well with smart technology.",",pos"
"From the reviews I have read so far from people bashing this OS, it really makes me wonder whether or not anyone actually downloaded a free tool from Microsoft's site called ""Vista Upgrade Advisor.""  Just because you might think that your system is high-end, it doesn't necessarily means its Vista-Ready yet.  This is the first tool anyone should run before buying Vista.  After the scan, it tells you whether or not your PC can handle Vista.  Furthermore, it even recommends which version(Basic, Premium, Business or Ultimate) to use.

Apart from that, it seems that Vista focuses too much on eye candy this time around.  Although you have to admit: the whole look is eye-catching.

However, as I am writing this, its been only a month since Vista hit the shelves, so its still not the most stable software in the world(and boy, do I ever use that term loosely here,) but with time it will be.  Let's not forget XP and their constant upgrades -- Vista will always have updates as well.  As of right now, it is very raw and if you have patience, you should wait until the dust clears and the price lowers in the upcoming months.  However, if you have a new PC and deciding between XP and Vista, definitely get Vista and get a head start by learning it's features.

Bottom Line:  Download Vista Upgrade Advisor before even having thoughts of getting Vista.  Just think of it as a ""test-drive"" without the driving.",",pos"

"I'm an interior designer, so the in which I use this program is different than an artist, so take this review with a grain of salt. I've been really putting the program through its paces over the last month or so.

I am an experienced Photoshopper and Sketchbook Pro user and I really wasn't expecting to love Corel Painter as much as those two programs. And admittedly, Corel isn't quite as versatile as PS, though I think it is actually better for straight art/drawing/painting applications than PS and certainly better than SBP. So if you need an art program and not an art/rendering/photo editing program, this is your guy.

Corel Painter has some features that I absolutely can't live without. The perspective tool is invaluable for making renderings that look proportional (and I imagine super handy for artists) and the brush search tool is so nice. The Watercolor and Flow maps are, as far as I know, unique to CP and make amazing works of art. They help your image really go from digital to real-world.

I use a Mac and CP has a feature that adjust the memory usage of your computer to optimize your program use, which is so clever and works  perfect. Working in CP becomes quick. And CP is much more user friendly and intuitive than PS, perhaps in part due to the limited capabilities (compared to PS), but also because it is well designed. And if you just can't live without your PS, CP is actually compatible with PS and even share some plug-ins.

CP has a seemingly endless supply of brush, paper texture and media. I have no doubt I haven't even gotten to half of them. It's really hard to capture all of the benefits of CP, but for any artist or designer out there, it really is a fantastic program. I'm so glad I made the switch.",",pos"
"I have had Kaspersky AV for four months.  I put it on a Windows XP laptop.  I generally use Mozilla Firefox as my web browser, but I couldn't get my work done because there were so many warnings from Kaspersky AV.  I tried Internet Explorer to browse, and it seemed to get even more warnings; I was at a standstill.  I went back to the laptop many times over several months with the same results.  I finally uninstalled Kapersky and went to my old stand-by, Norton AV.
I am no TechGuy; I cannot analyze why this program interfered with my computer use in such an aggravating fashion, but it sure did.  Did it do everything else it claims to do?  Yes, as far as I know.  But the slowdown wasn't worth the protection.",",neg"
"Microsoft's latest OS is, indeed, more secure than Windows XP.  But I have installed it twice on two different machines, and subsequently uninstalled it and went back to XP a few weeks later both times.  Why?

- Stability is poor.  The system frequently blue screens (crashes) or, more commonly, hangs.  It's not a hardware problem, because both systems experienced these issues, and neither system has any issues running XP.  Vista Media Center slowly degrades over time (one of the computers is my living room DVR) until it is unusable without a hourly reboot (seriously!)
- Speed - I play a lot of games, and Vista is consistently and significantly slower on every single game I've tried.  The difference is significant, even WITH the very latest ""Vista Certified"" video and sound drivers.  Then, there are games that crash on Vista, but have no issues on XP.  You can say ""Well, they were tested to work with XP"", and you'd be right, but I'd rather be running an OS that games were tested with.  And the DirectX 10 effects, which only Vista supports, are very ho-hum - they're not worth the performance hit, in my opinion.  For an example, check out the Crysis DirectX 9 vs. DirectX 10 comparisons on the net.
- Hardware support - this really is not Microsoft's fault, but it is still an issue.  Many hardware manufacturers quietly refusing to release drivers for their existing hardware, in an effort to force people to buy new hardware for Vista support.  That's totally not Microsoft's fault - but make sure your devices are Vista compatible, BEFORE you buy Vista.  Microsoft has a  good compatibility guide on their website for this.  Scanners, printers, music players, phones, and wireless network gear are the gadgets with the worst Vista driver support, as are notebooks not specifically ""designed for Vista"".

I'm not saying you should NOT buy Vista, but if you do, be prepared for the problems you will encounter.  It might be better for a business user who is buying all new Vista compatible hardware.",",neg"

"First off, I had used Microsoft Streets & Trips 2008 previously, and liked it very much, although I felt it could do a little better job of getting you to national parks, landmarks and other points of interest.  (For example, for Pike's Peak, it tried to take us up the back side of the mountain thru a locked private gate as opposed to getting us to the park entrance).  The 2009 version seems to do a much better job of getting you to where you want to go, and did actually take us to the correct entrance to Pike's Peak.  The directions also seem to be less confusing in the 2009 version vs. 2008 version.  I only wish it suggest points of interest that are near the route you are planning to make it a little easier to plan a family vacation with interesting stops along the way - it seems like a simple request, and I don't know why it can't do that.  However, as mapping software, it does great - directions are great and the screen is easy to follow and when paired with a usb gps you can be sure of never getting lost.  2009 is not a drastic improvement over the 2008 version, but with it's improved directions and location of national parks I would recommend upgrading from a previous version, and for first time purchasers, I would definitely recommend the Microsoft Streets and Trips for it's ease of use and excellent directions as well as full catalog of gas stations, rest areas, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. (one tip, if you can't find all these listing under Find Nearby, go in and check the other categories to have them show up - for some reaon the default is to only show a few categories as opposed to all of them).",",pos"
"Adding to previous review after using for another month and hate it even more.  Its buggy, forgets passwords every couple weeks, loads slow, shows no improvement over previous versions and clearly is only changed so that Intuit can continue to extort outrageous upgrade fees.

Didn't trust myself installing on my cells.  Good verbal guidance and written instructions were sent to me and resultant protection now resides on all my devices for one low price.  There is no better protection on the market in my opinion.  You can't go wrong with McAfee,",",pos"
