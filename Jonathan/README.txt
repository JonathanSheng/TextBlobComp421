I did not account for 0's as TextBlob only classifies negative and positive. Only classifies the data that is 1, 2, 4, 5 stars.  
Also used the 1-20 data set for training and the 1-1000 data set for testing
Binned data using Textblob, but it isn't using trained data, so I'm trying to figure out how to do that. Created confusion matrix.
